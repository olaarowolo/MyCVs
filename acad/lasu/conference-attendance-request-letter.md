Dear Sir,

## Notification and Request for Support

I am writing to formally notify the University Management of my acceptance to attend and present two research papers at the International Communication Association (ICA) 2026 Conference, scheduled to hold in South Africa, and to kindly request financial support in accordance with the Lagos State University Conditions of Service for Senior Staff.

### Conference Details
- **Conference:** International Communication Association (ICA) 2026
- **Venue:** South Africa
- **Duration:** [Insert dates]

### Papers to be Presented
1. **"Whose Voice Counts? Government Dominance and Press Release Reliance in Nigerian Newspaper Coverage of Social Investment Programmes"**

2. **"Electoral Weaponisation of Micro-Credit: Nigerian Newspaper Coverage of Tradermoni Vote-Buying Allegations During the 2018-2019 Election Cycle"**

Both papers are derived from my doctoral thesis, titled **"Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria's Social Investment Programmes,"** which was successfully completed with the support of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Academic Staff Training and Development intervention. These papers have been accepted for presentation at this prestigious international forum.

### Request for Support

In line with the **LASU Conditions of Service for Senior Staff, Chapter V - Welfare Services (Page 110)**, which provides for **"Passages for Staff Attending Local/International Conferences, Seminar/Symposia,"** and the **"Learned Conference Allowance"** (Page 141), I kindly request the University's assistance in the following areas:

1. **Conference Attendance Approval** – For official participation at ICA 2026
2. **Financial Support** – Towards travel passages (airfare) and accommodation
3. **Conference Attendance Leave** – As may be applicable

This conference presents a valuable opportunity for me to represent Lagos State University at an international level and to contribute to the global discourse in Communication and Journalism studies. The presentation of these papers will also enhance the University's reputation in the international academic community.

I am grateful for the University's continued support in my professional development and look forward to representing Lagos State University at this prestigious international forum.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
