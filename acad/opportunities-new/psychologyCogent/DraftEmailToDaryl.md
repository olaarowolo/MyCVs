Subject: Inquiry About Section Editor Role at Cogent Psychology

Dear Professor O'Connor,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across the call for applications for the Section Editor roles at *Cogent Psychology* and found the opportunity highly intriguing. Having reviewed the details provided, I would like to seek further clarification to ensure my application aligns with the journal's expectations.

Specifically, I would appreciate your insights on:

- The key qualities or experiences you are prioritizing in candidates for the 'Personality & Individual Differences' and 'Social Psychology' sections.
- Whether my background in academic publishing, peer review, and leadership roles in research aligns with the journal's vision for these roles.

I also wanted to mention that I received a sponsored LinkedIn email from Ben Hudson regarding this opportunity, which further piqued my interest in the role.

I hold a PhD in Journalism (awarded without corrections) and have extensive experience in academic publishing, including serving as a blind peer reviewer for Q2 journals and leading academic platforms. I am eager to understand how my skills and experiences might contribute to the journal's mission.

Thank you for your time and guidance. I look forward to your response and would be happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Best regards,
