Media, Poverty, and Democracy: A Comparative Analysis of Social Investment Discourse in the UK and Nigeria

Research Overview
This comparative study examines how media narratives around poverty and social investment shape democratic accountability and public engagement in the UK and Nigeria. Building on my PhD research on Nigeria's National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP), this project offers a unique North-South perspective on media's role in democratic processes.

Research Questions
1. How do mainstream and digital media in the UK and Nigeria frame poverty and social investment programmes?
2. What ideological and discursive strategies are used in media portrayals of welfare?
3. How do these narratives influence public trust, policy reception, and civic participation?
4. How can we develop a cross-cultural framework for understanding media's role in democratic accountability?

Methodology

- Content analysis of major newspapers, TV transcripts, and digital platforms (2015-2025)
- Critical discourse analysis of welfare reporting focusing on metaphors and beneficiary representation
- Elite interviews with 15-20 journalists, policy experts, and NGO advocates from both countries

Expected Outcomes
- Typology of media frames around social investment programmes
- Cross-cultural insights into poverty discourse politicization
- Digital dashboard tracking cross-country media discourse trends
- Policy briefs for media professionals and social policy actors
