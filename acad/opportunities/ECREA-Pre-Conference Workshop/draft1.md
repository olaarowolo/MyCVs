**Why would you like to participate in this workshop?**
As an early-career scholar with a PhD in Journalism (completed in 2025) and a focus on media representation, independent journalism, and the interplay between traditional and social media, I am keen to enhance my AI literacy to better understand and integrate emerging technologies like ChatGPT into my research and teaching. This workshop aligns perfectly with my interests in contemporary methodologies and effective communication of research findings, particularly in the context of democratic processes and marginalized voices. Participating will equip me with practical skills to navigate AI tools ethically and innovatively in academic and professional settings.

**What are your expectations or key questions for the workshop?**
I expect to gain hands-on knowledge on AI tools for research and writing, ethical considerations in AI use, and strategies for incorporating AI into journalism and communication studies. Key questions include: How can AI tools like ChatGPT be used responsibly in qualitative analysis and content creation? What are the potential biases in AI-generated content, and how can scholars mitigate them? How might AI transform media literacy and audience engagement in academic research?
