**Name:**  
Dr Olasunkanmi S. Arowolo  

**Institutional Affiliation:**  
University of Kent  

**Country of Residence:**  
United Kingdom  

**Current Academic Position:**  
- Early-career scholar (within 5 years of PhD)  

**Research Area(s) of Interest:**  
Media and communication studies, journalism, AI in media, framing analysis, social media discourse, poverty and democracy in developing nations and the UK.  

**Why would you like to participate in this workshop?**  
As a British Academy Global Talent-endorsed early-career scholar with a PhD in Journalism (awarded no corrections in 2025 from the University of Kent) and a growing portfolio of peer-reviewed publications on media framing, social media discourse, and poverty in democratic contexts, I am uniquely positioned to contribute to and benefit from this workshop. My research bridges UK and Nigerian media landscapes, exploring AI's role in amplifying marginalised voices and combating misinformation in welfare communication—a theme directly relevant to AI literacy. As founder of Afriscribe (afriscribe.org) and ResearchAfrica (researchafrica.pub), I have led initiatives promoting ethical journalism and open-access research in Africa, and I see this workshop as a critical opportunity to pioneer AI integration in my ongoing projects, such as comparative studies on algorithmic journalism governance. Despite not being registered for the main conference, my motivation stems from a commitment to advancing inclusive, AI-informed methodologies that can democratise knowledge production globally, making me an active contributor to discussions on ethical AI adoption in academia.  

**What are your expectations or key questions for the workshop?**  
I anticipate immersive, practical training on cutting-edge AI tools beyond ChatGPT, including their application in thematic analysis of social media data and content generation for policy-relevant research. I seek insights into mitigating algorithmic biases, especially in cross-cultural contexts like UK-Nigeria comparisons, and strategies for co-developing AI with diverse stakeholders to ensure equitable outcomes. Key questions: How can AI enhance qualitative research on media representation without perpetuating colonial biases? What frameworks exist for evaluating AI's impact on audience reception studies? How might AI literacy empower early-career scholars from underrepresented regions to lead in global media innovation, and what collaborative opportunities could emerge from this workshop for interdisciplinary projects?

**Are you registered for the ECREA ARS Mid-Term Conference?**
