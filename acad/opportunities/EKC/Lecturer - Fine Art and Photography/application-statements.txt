Question: Please tell us about your skills and experience, paying particular attention to the skills and experience identified on the Person specification for this role.

My extensive experience in digital media, photography, and further education teaching makes me a strong candidate for the Lecturer in Fine Art and Photography role. I have a proven track record of delivering engaging, industry-relevant teaching and possess the specific technical and pedagogical skills outlined in the person specification, which I have detailed below.

Skills

1. Effective written and oral communication: My academic career, culminating in a PhD with no corrections, demonstrates high-level written communication. Orally, I excel at making complex topics accessible, whether explaining photographic theory or critiquing fine art concepts. As runner-up in the University of Kent's 3-Minute-Thesis competition, I have proven my ability to communicate specialist knowledge clearly and concisely to a non-specialist audience.
2. Effective organisational skills and ability to work to deadline: My career demonstrates a consistent ability to manage complex projects and meet strict deadlines. This includes completing my PhD on schedule while teaching, and founding the digital platform Research Africa. Furthermore, as a Graphic Editor, I was solely responsible for the layout and production of over 32 weekly newspaper issues for LASUGONG, a role that required meticulous planning and time management to meet press deadlines. This experience is directly transferable to planning schemes of work, managing studio resources, and meeting assessment deadlines.
3. Effective teamwork skills: I have a strong history of collaboration, from co-authoring peer-reviewed articles with international scholars to working within departmental teams at East Kent College and the University of Kent. I actively contribute to a shared ethos of best practice, resource sharing, and collaborative planning to enhance the student learning journey.
4. Ability to motivate, encourage and support students: My teaching philosophy is centred on fostering student creativity and confidence. At East Kent College, I developed innovative teaching strategies that led to a 76% improvement in student engagement and grades. My commitment to student development extends beyond the classroom; as a student, I took on leadership roles such as Chairman of the Editorial Board for the Association of Campus Journalists, where I mentored and guided my peers. As a Personal Tutor, I have extensive experience providing both academic and pastoral support, helping students to overcome creative blocks and achieve their artistic and personal goals.
5. Familiarity with the use of IT: I possess advanced, industry-current IT skills essential for a modern Fine Art and Photography curriculum. I am an expert user of the full Adobe Creative Suite (including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro), Final Cut Pro, CorelDraw, and VLEs like Moodle. My practical experience, which includes a strong command of typography, extends to digital photography workflows, vector illustration, page layout, and video production, ensuring students learn current industry practices.
6. Actively contribute to the College’s Safeguarding practice: I am fully committed to my safeguarding responsibilities and have detailed my experience in the second statement.

Experience

1. Up to date industry experience: My industry experience is extensive, current, and directly relevant. As the founder and Director of OA MediaKraft, I built the company from the ground up, providing professional photography, video production, and graphic design services to both corporate and private clients in the UK and Nigeria. My practical expertise is further demonstrated by my long-term role as Graphic Editor for LASUGONG Newspaper, where I single-handedly designed over 32 complete issues and led a successful rebranding that attracted external funding. This hands-on experience in publication design, branding, and professional photography ensures I can teach students the real-world skills needed for a career in the creative industries.
2. Working knowledge of the requirements of Awarding Bodies: Through my lecturing role at East Kent College (Ashford), I have gained a practical understanding of the quality assurance frameworks of awarding bodies like Pearson. I have experience in designing curricula, creating assessment schedules, and participating in internal verification and self-assessment processes to meet these standards.
3. Relevant experience of lecturing/training/teaching: I have over eight years of teaching experience, including delivering practical, hands-on workshops and lectures in media and communication. My teaching at East Kent College involved both theoretical instruction and practical skills development, leading to a significant, measurable increase in student engagement and achievement.

Education

I confirm I meet the educational criteria for this role:

- Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training or PGCE: I am committed to excellence in teaching and, as the role permits, I am ready to undertake the Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training, which the College funds for successful candidates without a recognised teaching qualification.
- Appropriate professional qualification (minimum level 3): My PhD in Journalism is a Level 8 qualification, and my background includes extensive practical and academic work in visual communication.
- Maths, English, and IT at Level 2: I hold these qualifications.
- Assessor/Verifier Awards: I have practical experience acting as an internal assessor for student work as part of my lecturing duties at East Kent College.

As a Lecturer in Fine Art and Photography, I would bring a dynamic combination of current industry expertise, advanced technical skills, and a proven passion for student-centred teaching. I am confident I can inspire students and deliver an outstanding curriculum that prepares them for successful careers in the creative industries.

Question: Please provide evidence of your experience, knowledge and impact in keeping children and vulnerable adults safe.

I understand that safeguarding is a fundamental and proactive responsibility for every member of staff within an educational establishment. My knowledge and experience are rooted in the principle of protecting children, young people, and vulnerable adults from all forms of harm, abuse, and neglect, while actively promoting their health, wellbeing, and human rights.

Knowledge and Training:

My understanding of safeguarding is informed by current legislation and statutory guidance, including 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' and the Prevent Duty. In all my UK teaching roles at East Kent College, the University of Kent, and as a supply teacher across 14 Kent schools, I have completed mandatory annual safeguarding and Prevent training. This has ensured I am up-to-date on identifying signs of abuse, understanding radicalisation risks, and knowing the precise procedures for reporting concerns.

Practical Experience:

My experience as a Lecturer and Personal Tutor has provided me with direct, frontline responsibility for student welfare.

- Pastoral Support: I have served as the first point of contact for students facing academic and personal difficulties. This has involved holding regular one-to-one tutorials, creating a trusted environment for students to disclose concerns, and providing empathetic support and guidance.
- Identifying and Reporting Concerns: I have experience in identifying changes in behaviour, attendance, or appearance that could indicate a safeguarding issue. In such instances, I have diligently followed the established reporting procedures of the institution, documenting my concerns and escalating them to the designated safeguarding lead (DSL) promptly and confidentially. I understand the importance of early intervention and working collaboratively with the dedicated safeguarding team.
- Maintaining Professional Boundaries: In all interactions, I maintain professional boundaries, ensuring a safe and respectful learning environment. I model the positive and professional behaviour expected in the Staff Code of Conduct.

Application to the Lecturer Role:

As a Lecturer, I see myself as a key part of the college's safeguarding framework. I would ensure that:

- All my teaching, including practical workshops in photography and fine art, is conducted in a safe, inclusive, and supportive manner.
- I actively contribute to a culture where students feel safe and know who to turn to for help.
- I remain vigilant and confident in applying the college's reporting mechanisms to protect students.
- Student welfare is a primary consideration in my role as a Personal Tutor and in all my interactions, ensuring a holistic and protective environment for every learner in my care.
