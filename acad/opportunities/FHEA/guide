1. Reflective Account of Practice (RAP)
Target word count: 3,000–4,000 words; below is a condensed, evidence-mapped draft.

Introduction
I have been teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate level for over a decade, working in diverse educational contexts in the UK and internationally. My teaching has been grounded in inclusive, research-led practice, drawing from my PhD in Journalism and Digital Governance to provide students with contemporary, globally relevant learning experiences. This account demonstrates my practice against the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) Areas of Activity, Core Knowledge, and Professional Values.

A1 – Design and plan learning activities
At the University of Kent, I redesigned seminar structures for the Media, Politics, and Development module to integrate comparative UK–Nigeria case studies. This ensured alignment with QAA subject benchmarks, incorporated authentic assessments, and responded to student feedback for more real-world engagement.

A2 – Teach and/or support learning
My teaching approach blends lectures, interactive seminars, and digital tools. For example, in Kent seminars, I used Padlet for collaborative brainstorming and Microsoft Teams breakout rooms to facilitate group analysis of news content, enabling active participation from students across different cultural backgrounds.

A3 – Assess and give feedback
I developed formative assessments with clear marking rubrics, allowing students to self-assess before submission. Feedback was provided through annotated scripts and short video recordings, which increased clarity and was praised in module evaluations for being “clear, actionable, and encouraging.”

A4 – Develop effective learning environments
Teaching international cohorts required sensitivity to language, prior educational experience, and cultural differences. I used a mix of case studies, multimedia, and discussion formats to ensure inclusivity. Physical classroom layouts and online platforms were adapted to maximise peer learning.

A5 – Engage in CPD in subjects/pedagogy
I have attended Advance HE webinars on inclusive assessment and completed internal University of Kent workshops on curriculum design and student engagement. I actively integrate insights from pedagogical literature and conferences into my practice.

Core Knowledge (K1–K6)
Throughout my teaching:

K1: I maintain up-to-date subject knowledge in journalism, media studies, and digital governance.

K2: I apply pedagogical approaches such as flipped learning and inquiry-based learning.

K3: I understand how students learn in varied cultural contexts.

K4–K6: I use appropriate technologies, assess effectively, and engage with literature to improve teaching.

Professional Values (V1–V4)
I uphold:

V1: Respect for diverse learners through inclusive design.

V2: Promotion of equality of opportunity, embedding diverse perspectives in course materials.

V3: Evidence-based practice informed by research.

V4: Continuous improvement through CPD and reflection.

Impact
Improved student satisfaction scores for redesigned modules at Kent.

Positive qualitative feedback praising interactive delivery and relevant examples.
