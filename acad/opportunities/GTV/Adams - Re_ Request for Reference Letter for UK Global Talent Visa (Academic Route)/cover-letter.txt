Dear Professor Burgess,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am pleased to share the exciting news that I have recently passed my PhD viva at the University of Kent without corrections. This milestone is an important step in my academic career, and I am now preparing to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa under the Academic and Research route, endorsed by the British Academy.

Given our collaboration in co-teaching SOCI3370 Fundamentals of Sociology, where I also assessed, marked, graded, and provided constructive feedback that significantly contributed to the success of the Moodle delivery and resulted in very positive student evaluations, I would be honoured if you could provide a reference letter in support of my visa application. Additionally, I have convened the Studying Journalism module at the Centre for Journalism, which also garnered strong positive feedback, further demonstrating my teaching effectiveness and contribution to academic programmes.

Beyond my teaching, I maintain an active publication record and research portfolio. Some of my recent works are not fully captured in the University of Kent’s academic repository (Kent Academic Repository search link). However, my Google Scholar profile reflects a growing impact, with over 261 citations in the past five years (Google Scholar profile). Additionally, I have recent news mention published in major outlets such as Vanguard Nigeria (Vanguard article).

The British Academy requires referees to address the exceptional talent criteria, so it would be helpful if your letter could include:

Your professional relationship with me and an overview of our joint work in teaching, assessment, and feedback.
An evaluation of my contributions to teaching, research, and the academic community, including evidence of positive student feedback and my active research profile.
New mention on the quality and significance of my doctoral research, now successfully completed without corrections (please feel free to reference this article about my PhD accomplishment: The Sun Article) and how I fit in for exceptional talent route.
An endorsement of my potential to make significant contributions to the UK academic and research landscape.
Your contact details, official title, and letterhead.

As a guide based on British Academy website:
The letter must include:
a statement confirming that the author is a senior member of a reputable UK organisation concerned with research or innovation in your field;
the reasons why the author considers that your work shows exceptional talent and how you are likely to contribute to UK research or innovation excellence and to wider society; and
a statement confirming the author’s assessment is provided in their capacity as an objective expert in your field and is an objective assessment of your reputation in the field, notwithstanding any personal knowledge they may have of you or any direct involvement they may have (or previously have had) in your work.

The letter should be addressed to:
Global Talent Visa Endorsement Panel

British Academy

I would be grateful if the reference could be prepared within the next one week, to support my timely application submission. I am happy to provide any further information or my updated CV to assist you.
Thank you very much for considering my request and for your support throughout my academic journey.

Warm regards,
