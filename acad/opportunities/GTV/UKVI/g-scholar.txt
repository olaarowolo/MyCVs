4,9,14,19, 24, ...

what is the formular for nth terms and what is the 10th sequence
GPT-4o Mini
To find the formula for the ( n )th term of the sequence ( 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, ... ), we first need to identify the pattern in the sequence.
Calculating the differences between successive terms:

( 9 - 4 = 5 )

( 14 - 9 = 5 )

( 19 - 14 = 5 )

( 24 - 19 = 5 )


The difference between each successive term is constant and equal to 5. This indicates that this is an arithmetic sequence.
In an arithmetic sequence, the ( n )th term can be expressed using the formula:
[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d
]
where:

( a_n ) is the ( n )th term,

( a_1 ) is the first term,

( d ) is the common difference,

( n ) is the term number.


For this sequence:

( a_1 = 4 ) (the first term),

( d = 5 ) (the common difference).


Plugging these values into the formula gives:
[
a_n = 4 + (n - 1) \cdot 5
]
Simplifying that, we get:
[
a_n = 4 + 5n - 5 = 5n - 1
]
Now we have the formula for the ( n )th term: 
[
a_n = 5n - 1
]
To find the 10th term (( n = 10 )):
[
a_{10} = 5(10) - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49
]
So, the 10th term in the sequence is 49.
