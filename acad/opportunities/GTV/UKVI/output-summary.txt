1.	Journalism Ethics: The Dilemma, Social and Contextual Constraints

Cogent Social Sciences 10(1), 2328388 | Citations: 6 | Year: 2024
Summary: Journalism, with its claim to professionalism, is guided in its practice by ethical codes which prescribe what is considered ‘good work’. This theoretical article argues that, though based on certain universal prescriptions, ethics is socially and culturally situated. The observance of the codes is socially determined based on the prevailing moral and political conditions. It is also argued that the issue of the type and quality of representations available in the media should also be of concern when we discuss ethics. The article discusses some of the social constraints to the observance of ethics within the Nigerian context and argues for the need to pay greater attention to addressing the material and economic barriers to media access and representation.

Summary: This article presents a conceptual argument on good governance from the World Bank’s and other relevant experts’perspectives. For good governance to be achieved in an effective manner, it is essential for all parties to play a relevant role, including individuals, the general public, the government, and the news media.Also, several factors contribute to good governance, these include accountability, equity, and justice, protection of life and properties, upholding the rule of law, amongst others. The mass media is regarded to be the greatest backbone of democracy and the most effective tool for investigating, informing, and educating the public on issues that are important to the everyday lives of the citizenry, to enhance participation, and ultimately for Nigeria to achieve adequate good governance. Thus, this paper recommends that to effectively achieve good governance, there is a need for absolute resolve and the willingness to change our mindset, way of life as well as partisan-media dynamics.
