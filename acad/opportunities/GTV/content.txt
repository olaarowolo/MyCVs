Global Talent Endorsement Statement
Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo

I am a dedicated researcher and educator whose work bridges academic excellence and societal impact within the UK. My doctoral research examines how media narratives influence perceptions and outcomes around poverty and social investment, directly intersecting with UK priorities in education, governance, and social mobility. This research contributes to UK academia by advancing comparative media studies, particularly in UK-Nigeria contexts, and by developing innovative frameworks for understanding media’s role in democratic accountability and social policy.

Beyond academia, I am already addressing critical societal issues locally and personally through mentoring and motivational education outreach. By helping young people reflect on their purpose and long-term goals, I support them in becoming intentional about school, career, and life – a shift that ultimately disrupts cycles of poverty. Having engaged secondary school and college students through public speaking and personal mentoring, I continue to champion purposeful learning as a foundational tool for societal transformation.

My teaching roles at UK institutions, including the University of Kent and East Kent College, have enabled me to develop tailored curricula that enhance media literacy and communication skills, equipping students to engage critically with social issues. These efforts align with national societal development priorities by fostering inclusive education and empowering the next generation of informed citizens.

I have demonstrated exceptional talent and a strong track record through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and leadership in digital media initiatives within UK community organizations. My work has been recognized through competitive scholarships and awards, underscoring my commitment to research excellence and societal contribution.

In summary, my research and outreach activities exemplify the integration of UK research excellence with impactful societal engagement. I am committed to continuing this trajectory, contributing to the UK’s academic landscape and national development goals as a Global Talent endorsed researcher.
