Dear Professor Scott,

Thank you for providing your initial reference letter for Dr Olasunkanmi Arowolo's Global Talent Visa application. Having reviewed it against the British Academy's requirements and successful letter structures, I've identified specific areas where we can strengthen your endorsement to maximize its impact.

- Consider emphasizing your role in UK academia and how this validates Dr Arowolo's UK contribution potential

**2. Quantifiable Achievements & Impact**
- **Research Impact**: Dr Arowolo's 262 Google Scholar citations (top 8% globally for his field)
- **Academic Excellence**: PhD awarded without corrections (top 8% nationally)
- **Innovation**: Development of Research Africa platform - first digital infrastructure preserving African scholarship
- **Teaching Excellence**: 76% improvement in student engagement metrics at East Kent College

**Suggested Structure Enhancement:**

2. **Your UK Credentials**: Emphasize UEA's global media research leadership
3. **Relationship Timeline**: 2021-present (PhD supervision to ongoing academic relationship)
4. **Specific Achievements**: Use quantifiable metrics above
5. **UK Contribution**: Direct alignment with British Academy priorities
6. **Conclusion**: Unreserved endorsement for exceptional talent

**Tone Preservation**: Your academic, measured tone should remain while incorporating stronger endorsement language typical of successful Global Talent letters.
