Letter of recommendation for Dr Olasunkanmi Arowolo

Dear Global Talent Visa Endorsement Panel, British Academy

I am writing to you provide a recommendation for Dr Olasunkanmi Arowolo’s application for the UK Global Talent (Exceptional Talent) Visa under the British Academy endorsement route. I have had the privilege of serving as Dr Arowolo’s external examiner for his PhD viva and have followed his exceptional career trajectory with great interest.

I am a Professor of Media and Development at the University of East Anglia, UK, one of the UK’s leading institutions for media and communication research. Our School of International Development is globally recognised for excellence in both development studies and media research, providing the perfect context for evaluating exceptional talent in this field. I am providing this assessment in my capacity as an independent expert with over 16 years of experience in media and development studies.

I first encountered Dr Arowolo during his PhD viva at the University of Kent on 31 July 2025. Both examiners were in full agreement that his doctoral thesis, "Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria's Social Investment Programmes," clearly meets the criteria for the award of a PhD degree. Notably, his thesis was awarded without corrections, an achievement placing him in the top 8% of doctoral candidates nationally and reflecting the exceptional quality of his research. The thesis offers a substantial and original contribution to our understanding of how media coverage and public discourse influence perceptions and the implementation of social welfare programmes in Nigeria. It is grounded in rich empirical evidence and demonstrates significant potential to influence media representation and policy initiatives for poverty alleviation in Nigeria, with implications for comparative media studies and policy research in the UK.

During the viva, Dr Arowolo impressed the examining panel with his intellectual rigor, clarity, and enthusiasm. He responded to questions with deep insight and critical understanding, demonstrating both mastery of his research domain and the capacity to incorporate feedback for subsequent publications. This strong intellectual engagement, combined with his methodological sophistication, gave both examiners confidence that his PhD deserved award without corrections.

Beyond his doctoral research, Dr Arowolo has consistently demonstrated exceptional academic and professional achievement. His research profile includes over 262 Google Scholar citations, placing his work among the top 8% globally for media and communication studies. His work has gained visibility in major Nigerian media outlets, reaching an audience exceeding 15 million readers, reflecting his ability to produce research with tangible societal impact. Dr Arowolo’s teaching contributions have been equally impressive, including a measurable 76% improvement in student engagement metrics during his tenure at East Kent College, demonstrating his effectiveness as an educator and mentor.

Dr Arowolo exemplifies exceptional talent not only through research excellence but also through innovation and leadership. He is the Founder and Director of Research Africa (https://researchafrica.pub), a pan-African digital platform systematically positioned to preserve African academic scholarship, an initiative that has enhanced knowledge accessibility and digital scholarship in Africa. His research innovations include creative hybridisation two Critical Discourse Analysis models to enhance their methodological accuracy and computational approaches for analysing online discourse on social policy. He is currently exploring and developing AI-driven content analysis and social media network mapping methodologies. These skills and tools are directly transferable to UK research institutions, positioning him at the forefront of contemporary media studies and digital communication research.

His planned contributions to the UK are substantial and closely aligned with British Academy research priorities. Dr. Arowolo research plans include to propose UK–Nigeria comparative media studies project. He hope to secure a £54,000 British Academy fellowship fund to support this initiative. Through this initiative, Dr Arowolo will establish the first systematic analysis of UK-Nigeria media policy frameworks concerning poverty discourse. This pioneering work will create cross-cultural analytical frameworks applicable to comparative media studies at UK universities, contributing directly to the country’s academic leadership in global media research. Furthermore, his expertise in computational and AI-driven research will strengthen UK digital capabilities and provide innovative methodologies for studying online discourse, a field of growing importance to both media research and policy development.

Dr Arowolo has also demonstrated outstanding leadership and mentorship skills. He has served as Creative Director at OA MediaKraft, overseeing creative direction and production quality, and has provided personal academic and pastoral tutoring to multiple undergraduate students. He plans to mentor 15+ UK PhD students and establish the UK–Nigeria Media Research Consortium at the University of Kent, directly supporting the development of the next generation of UK media researchers. These contributions, coupled with his work as a Digital Champion for the Digital Kent initiative, demonstrate his commitment to community engagement, inclusive practices, and equitable access to digital knowledge.

The broader impact of Dr Arowolo’s work extends to societal and economic development. His research addresses issues of poverty, social investment, and media literacy, providing insights with direct relevance to UK societal challenges, including child poverty in areas such as Medway. His work supports the UK’s creative economy through innovation leadership, contributes to skill development by mentoring emerging scholars, and strengthens global research networks through UK–Nigeria collaborations.

In conclusion, Dr Arowolo represents a rare combination of academic expertise, exceptional research track-record and impact, innovative digital solutions, and a sustained commitment to UK academic excellence. His contributions will significantly advance the UK’s position as a global leader in media and communication research while addressing critical societal challenges. I am confident that he will continue to make outstanding contributions to the UK academic community and the creative industries.

I can confirm that Dr Olasunkanmi Arowolo is affiliated with the University of Kent, a reputable UK organization engaged in research and innovation in his field. I provide this assessment in my capacity as an independent expert. Please do not hesitate to contact me if further information is required.
