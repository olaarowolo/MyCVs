Beyond traditional academic outputs, I have created Research Africa, a pioneering digital platform that addresses the structural divide between African scholarship and global academic infrastructure. This innovation has achieved national media recognition from Nigeria's leading outlets including Premium Times, The Nation, Vanguard, and DevReporting. The platform ensures integration with international research repositories, guaranteeing African scholarship meets global academic standards while creating measurable impact on citation patterns and international research collaboration for African scholars. It serves as a vital mechanism for preservation and dissemination of African academic content to global audiences.

UK Academic Integration and British Academy Alignment
My exceptional UK academic integration is evidenced through my role as Research Assistant on the British Academy-GCRF funded "PNEUMA-CITY" project from 2022 to 2023, contributing to the £1.2 million British Academy research programme on urban infrastructures of well-being. My teaching experience spans over eight years of international Higher Education, including more than three years of UK university teaching excellence, complemented by supply teaching across over ten grammar and other middle schools throughout Kent. This extensive experience demonstrates my deep integration with the UK educational landscape and my commitment to British academic standards.

My current research portfolio demonstrates ongoing UK academic engagement through comparative studies of independent journalism funding models in the UK and Nigeria, research on reclaiming authenticity in Nigerian press coverage of social investment programmes, and analysis of the sidelined voices of the poor in media framing. These projects directly contribute to British Academy research priorities in media and democratic discourse.
