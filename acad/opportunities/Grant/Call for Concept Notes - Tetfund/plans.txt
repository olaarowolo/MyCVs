Research Plans Addressing UK Societal Issues and Beyond
My research agenda addresses critical UK societal issues while situating them in a broader global and comparative framework. The central aim is to examine how media narratives shape public understanding of poverty, social investment, and democratic participation, using a UK–Nigeria comparative approach to uncover ideological and discursive strategies in welfare reporting. This analysis will assess their influence on public trust, policy reception, and civic engagement.

The plans is structured around nine interconnected research streams:

1.	UK–Nigeria Comparative Media Studies (British Academy Fellowship)
	Status: Active proposal in preparation for submission
	Focus: Comparative analysis of UK and Nigerian media framing of poverty and social investment
	Methodology: Mixed-methods combining content analysis, discourse analysis, and elite interviews
	Timeline: 24-month study of media output from 2015–2025
	Budget: £54,000 for cross-country research
	Output: Digital dashboard tracking cross-country media discourse trends
2.	AI & Journalism Ethics Research Stream
	Status: Short-term priority (1–2 years)
	Focus: Ethical implications of AI in news production for democratic participation
	Collaboration: UK–US–Africa research network
	Funding: UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (£150k British Academy application in development)
3.	Digital Methods Innovation
	Status: Ongoing development
	Focus: Computational approaches for studying online discourse around social policy
	Innovation: Cross-cultural analytical frameworks for UK universities
	Techniques: Computational text analysis and social media network analysis
4.	Independent Journalism Ecosystems Study
	Status: Active – UK–Nigeria comparative study
	Focus: Independent journalism funding models
	Policy Relevance: Aligned with UK creative industries policy priorities
	Impact: Understanding how technological disruption affects journalistic independence and accountability
5.	Science Communication & Public Engagement 
I am one of the few Association of British Science Writers (ABSW) Summer School Awardees, where I learn about Science Writing. This was coming after my major Science communication research presented at the PCST 2025 conference in Aberdeen. This experience and knowledge has driven to create a new niche in niche communication research, particularly within professional journalism practices. 
	Status: Pilot completed – scaling up
	Focus: Bridging the gap between scientific research and public engagement
	Methodology: Mixed-methods study on media mediation of scientific research
	Dissemination: Presenting findings at the International Conference on Science Communication, Abuja (October 2025)

	Status: Active – data collection (June–August 2025)
	Focus: Nationwide mapping of Nigerian newsroom demographics
	Scale: 500–1,000 participants
	Next Step: UK Contemporary Newsroom Mapping project

7.	Policy Impact Research Agenda
	Status: Medium-term (3–5 years)
	Focus: Research directly informing UK media policy and regulation
	Funding Goal: £2M endowment for a permanent UK–Nigeria Research Chair in Media and Democracy
	Network: FCDO, DCMS, BBC World Service, Guardian Foundation
8.	Digital Democracy Research
	Status: Long-term vision

	Infrastructure: UK–Nigeria Media Research Consortium at the University of Kent
9.	Global South Media Research Hub
	Status: Strategic initiative
	Focus: Establishing an institutional hub under my leadership as a global authority in Global South media research
	Partnerships: UK–Global South interdisciplinary collaborations
	Impact: Strengthening the UK’s position as a leader in global research and societal development

Debut Project: Positioning Nigerian Newspapers on the Political Spectrum: An Empirical Analysis of Editorial Slants and Issue Coverage
To establish the UK as a global authority in Global South media research, this inaugural study delivers the first empirical map of Nigeria’s press landscape. Through systematic content analysis of editorial slants and issue coverage across leading national newspapers, the project uncovers how media outlets align with political parties, state interests, and civic movements. By combining rigorous quantitative framing analysis with UK–Global South interdisciplinary collaboration, the research not only strengthens the UK’s leadership in global media scholarship but also provides policymakers, journalists, and civil society with evidence-based insights to safeguard democratic discourse in Africa’s largest democracy.
