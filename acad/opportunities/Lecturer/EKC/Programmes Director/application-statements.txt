Question: Please provide evidence of your experience, knowledge and impact in keeping children and vulnerable adults safe.

I understand that safeguarding is a fundamental and proactive responsibility for every member of staff within an educational establishment. My knowledge and experience are rooted in the principle of protecting children, young people, and vulnerable adults from all forms of harm, abuse, and neglect, while actively promoting their health, wellbeing, and human rights.

Knowledge and Training:

My understanding of safeguarding is informed by current legislation and statutory guidance, including 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' and the Prevent Duty. In all my UK teaching roles at East Kent College, the University of Kent, and as a supply teacher across 14 Kent schools, I have completed mandatory annual safeguarding and Prevent training. This has ensured I am up-to-date on identifying signs of abuse, understanding radicalisation risks, and knowing the precise procedures for reporting concerns.

Practical Experience:

My experience as a Lecturer and Personal Tutor has provided me with direct, frontline responsibility for student welfare.

- Pastoral Support: I have served as the first point of contact for students facing academic and personal difficulties. This has involved holding regular one-to-one tutorials, creating a trusted environment for students to disclose concerns, and providing empathetic support and guidance.
- Identifying and Reporting Concerns: I have experience in identifying changes in behaviour, attendance, or appearance that could indicate a safeguarding issue. In such instances, I have diligently followed the established reporting procedures of the institution, documenting my concerns and escalating them to the designated safeguarding lead (DSL) promptly and confidentially. I understand the importance of early intervention and working collaboratively with the dedicated safeguarding team.
- Maintaining Professional Boundaries: In all interactions, I maintain professional boundaries, ensuring a safe and respectful learning environment. I model the positive and professional behaviour expected in the Staff Code of Conduct.

Application to the Programme Director Role:

As a Programme Director, I would champion a robust safeguarding culture across the entire programme. This extends beyond personal responsibility to a leadership function. I would ensure that:

- The curriculum and all learning activities are designed and delivered in a safe, inclusive, and supportive manner.
- The entire programme team is aware of their safeguarding duties and feels confident in the college's reporting mechanisms.
- Student welfare is a key consideration in all aspects of programme management, from recruitment and induction to work experience placements and progression, ensuring a holistic and protective environment for every learner.
