Subject: Request for Approval to List You as a Referee in My CV

Dear Dr Cocking,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently preparing my application for the Lecturer (Teaching and Research) position at Cardiff University's School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies.

I would like to respectfully request your permission to list you as an academic referee in my CV as part of this application. Your support as my PhD supervisor and Director of Research at Kent's Centre for Journalism would be invaluable.

Please let me know if you are comfortable with this and if you require any further information from me.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Best regards,
