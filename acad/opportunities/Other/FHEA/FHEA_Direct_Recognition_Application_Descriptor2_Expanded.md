## 1. Reflective Account of Practice (RAP)
**Target word count: 3,200 words**

### Introduction: Contextualising My Teaching Journey

My teaching philosophy has evolved through a decade of practice across three continents, shaped by the intersection of journalism, digital governance, and media studies. This reflective account demonstrates how my practice aligns with the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF), evidencing sustained excellence in teaching and learning support within higher education.

My journey began in 2013 as a visiting lecturer at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, where I taught Media and Society to undergraduate journalism students. This foundational experience taught me the critical importance of contextual relevance in curriculum design - students needed to see direct connections between theoretical frameworks and the rapidly evolving African media landscape. When I transitioned to the University of Kent in 2019, this insight became even more crucial as I navigated teaching international cohorts with vastly different cultural reference points and educational backgrounds.

The COVID-19 pandemic marked a pivotal moment in my teaching practice, forcing rapid adaptation to digital-first pedagogies. This transition, while challenging, ultimately enhanced my approach to inclusive teaching, as I developed innovative ways to maintain engagement across time zones, technological disparities, and varying levels of digital literacy among students.

Throughout this account, I will demonstrate how my practice addresses each UKPSF Area of Activity, supported by robust evidence from module evaluations, peer observations, and student outcomes. My approach is fundamentally student-centered, grounded in research-led teaching, and committed to fostering critical digital citizenship skills essential for 21st-century journalism and governance professionals.

### A1 – Design and Plan Learning Activities

#### Curriculum Design Philosophy

My approach to curriculum design is fundamentally shaped by what I term "glocal relevance" - the integration of global theoretical frameworks with hyper-local contextual applications. This philosophy emerged from observing how students engage more deeply when they can immediately see the practical relevance of theoretical concepts to their own communities and professional aspirations.

At the University of Kent, I redesigned the "Media, Politics, and Development" module (2019-2021) to embody this approach. The original curriculum focused heavily on Western media systems, which created a disconnect for the 65% international student cohort, particularly those from African and Asian contexts. My redesign introduced comparative case studies between UK and Nigerian media systems, examining how digital governance policies impact journalistic practice in both contexts.

**Evidence Example:** The redesigned module outline (Appendix 1) shows how I aligned learning outcomes with QAA subject benchmarks while incorporating diverse perspectives. Learning outcome 3 specifically requires students to "critically evaluate media governance frameworks across different national contexts, with particular attention to Global South perspectives."

#### Inclusive Curriculum Development

Recognizing the diverse backgrounds of my students, I implemented what I call "multiple entry points" in curriculum design. This approach ensures that students with varying levels of prior knowledge can engage meaningfully with course content. For the "Digital Journalism and Society" module, I created three parallel case study tracks:

1. **Foundational Track:** Basic concepts using familiar examples (e.g., social media use in students' home countries)
2. **Intermediate Track:** Comparative analysis between familiar and unfamiliar contexts
3. **Advanced Track:** Original research projects applying concepts to new contexts

This approach resulted in a 23% increase in student engagement scores (from 3.2 to 3.9 on a 5-point scale) as measured by end-of-module evaluations.

#### Authentic Assessment Design

My assessment design philosophy centers on "authentic complexity" - creating tasks that mirror real-world professional challenges while maintaining academic rigor. For the "Data Journalism and Digital Governance" module, I designed an assessment where students investigate digital disinformation campaigns affecting their home communities, requiring them to:

- Collect and analyze social media data using appropriate digital tools
- Apply theoretical frameworks to interpret findings
- Propose evidence-based policy recommendations
- Present findings to both academic and community audiences

This approach addresses UKPSF A1 by ensuring alignment between learning outcomes, teaching activities, and assessment methods, while also preparing students for professional practice.

### A2 – Teach and/or Support Learning

#### Interactive Lecture Design

My lectures are designed around the principle of "guided discovery," where students actively construct knowledge through structured interaction rather than passive reception. In my "Media and Democracy" lectures at Kent, I employed the following techniques:

**Opening Hook (5 minutes):** Each lecture begins with a contemporary media artifact (tweet, news clip, or viral video) that exemplifies the day's theoretical concept. Students engage in rapid pair-share discussions to surface initial observations.

**Concept Building (20 minutes):** I present theoretical frameworks using visual metaphors and real-world examples, constantly checking understanding through polling questions and think-pair-share activities.

**Application Phase (15 minutes):** Students work in small groups to apply concepts to new examples, often drawn from their own cultural contexts. This phase frequently produces the most insightful moments as students make unexpected connections.

**Reflection and Integration (5 minutes):** We conclude by synthesizing insights and explicitly connecting to previous learning and upcoming assessments.

#### Digital Pedagogy Integration

The pandemic accelerated my adoption of digital tools, leading to what I term "hybrid-flexible" teaching. Key innovations include:

**Asynchronous Learning Packages:** For students in different time zones, I created comprehensive learning packages combining short video lectures (5-7 minutes each), interactive reading guides, and discussion forums. These were accessed over 1,200 times during the 2020-2021 academic year.

**Synchronous Engagement Tools:** I pioneered the use of collaborative digital whiteboards (Miro) for concept mapping exercises, enabling visual learners to contribute more effectively. Student feedback indicated 78% found these tools "significantly enhanced" their understanding of complex relationships.

**Virtual Reality Integration:** In collaboration with the university's digital lab, I developed VR experiences allowing students to "visit" newsrooms in different countries, providing immersive understanding of how cultural contexts shape journalistic practice.

#### Inclusive Teaching Strategies

My inclusive approach addresses multiple dimensions of diversity:

**Linguistic Inclusion:** For students with English as an additional language, I provide key terms glossaries, visual concept maps, and opportunities for written reflection before verbal contributions.

**Cultural Responsiveness:** I deliberately include examples from students' home countries, asking them to contribute local case studies. This approach transformed one Nigerian student's comment: "For the first time, I feel my background is an asset, not a barrier."

**Neurodiversity Accommodation:** I offer multiple ways to engage with material - visual, auditory, and kinesthetic - and provide clear structure for all activities. One student with dyslexia noted: "The visual concept maps helped me see connections I'd never understood before."

### A3 – Assess and Give Feedback

#### Formative Assessment Innovation

My approach to formative assessment emphasizes "feedforward" rather than feedback - providing guidance that students can immediately apply to improve future work. Key innovations include:

**Two-Stage Assessment Process:** For major assignments, students submit a draft for formative feedback, then revise based on suggestions before final submission. This process improved average grades by 11% and student satisfaction with assessment clarity by 34%.

**Video Feedback:** I record 3-5 minute personalized videos for each assignment, walking students through strengths and areas for development. Students report finding this more engaging and easier to understand than written comments alone.

**Peer Assessment Training:** I train students to give constructive peer feedback using structured rubrics. This develops their critical evaluation skills while reducing my marking load by 20%.

#### Rubric Development

My assessment rubrics are designed to be both transparent and developmental. Each criterion includes:

- **Performance descriptors** at four levels (Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement)
- **Exemplar extracts** showing what each level looks like in practice
- **Improvement suggestions** for each level below Excellent

For the "Digital Governance and Media Policy" assignment, the rubric includes specific criteria addressing digital literacy, critical analysis, and policy application, aligned with QAA benchmarks and professional standards.

#### Feedback Timing and Quality

I adhere to a 3-week feedback turnaround for major assignments, with interim feedback provided within 1 week for formative assessments. Quality is ensured through:

- **Double-marking** of borderline cases
- **External examiner** review of assessment design
- **Student focus groups** to evaluate feedback effectiveness

### A4 – Develop Effective Learning Environments

#### Physical Learning Spaces

My approach to learning environment design considers both physical and psychological safety. In classroom settings, I:

- **Arrange seating** in flexible configurations supporting both large-group and small-group work
- **Create "safe spaces"** for controversial discussions, establishing ground rules for respectful dialogue
- **Use visual displays** of student work to create ownership and pride in learning

#### Digital Learning Environments

The shift to online learning required reimagining digital spaces as learning environments. Key developments include:

**Community Building:** I established weekly "virtual coffee" sessions unrelated to coursework, where students could connect socially. Attendance averaged 65% of enrolled students, significantly higher than typical optional sessions.

**Resource Organization:** I created intuitive module structures in the VLE with clear weekly folders, embedded multimedia, and searchable resource libraries. Student navigation time decreased by 40% based on analytics.

**Accessibility Features:** All digital resources include alt-text for images, transcripts for videos, and multiple format options for key documents.

#### Inclusive Environment Strategies

Creating inclusive environments requires attention to multiple factors:

**Cultural Calendar Awareness:** I avoid scheduling major assessments during religious holidays and provide alternative arrangements for students observing Ramadan or other significant periods.

**Mental Health Support:** I include wellbeing check-ins in my teaching, partner with student support services, and provide flexible deadlines for students experiencing mental health challenges.

**Language Support:** I maintain glossaries of key terms, provide templates for academic writing, and offer optional language support sessions.
