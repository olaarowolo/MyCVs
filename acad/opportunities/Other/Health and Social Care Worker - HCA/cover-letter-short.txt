Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Health and Social Care Worker position in your Supported Living program, as referred by Sis. Sophie. With over three years of experience in health and social care, including as a Health Care Assistant and Lecturer, I am passionate about empowering vulnerable adults and elderly individuals to live independently.

My background includes providing high-quality personal care, assisting with daily living activities like medication management and personal hygiene, and developing individualised support plans. I have advocated for residents' rights, promoted community engagement, and ensured safe, dignified environments. My teaching experience has equipped me to support skill-building and transitions, aligning with your program's focus on autonomy and well-being.

I am flexible, adaptable, and committed to confidentiality and infection control, holding certifications such as the Care Certificate and Basic Life Support.

Please find my CV attached. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Ideal Care Services.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
