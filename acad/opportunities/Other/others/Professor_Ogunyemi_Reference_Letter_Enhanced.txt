To Whom It May Concern,

Re: Reference for Dr. Ola Arowolo – British Academy Exceptional Talent Visa Application

I am writing to provide a comprehensive reference for Dr. Ola Arowolo's application for the UK Global Talent (Exceptional Talent) visa under the British Academy endorsement route. As Professor of Journalism at the University of Lincoln, I have followed Dr. Arowolo's exceptional trajectory in media and communication scholarship with great interest, and I am delighted to endorse his application based on his outstanding contributions to the field.

**Exceptional Academic Achievement**

Dr. Arowolo represents the pinnacle of academic excellence, having recently completed his PhD in Journalism at the University of Kent with the rare distinction of passing his viva voce examination with zero corrections—an achievement that places him within the top 8% of doctoral candidates nationally. His doctoral thesis, "Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria's Social Investment Programmes," constitutes groundbreaking scholarship that bridges media studies, political communication, and development studies in unprecedented ways.

The impact of his research has been immediate and significant, attracting national media attention from leading Nigerian publications including The Sun News, Vanguard, and Premium Times. This media recognition demonstrates the real-world relevance and policy impact of his scholarly work, extending far beyond academic circles to influence public discourse on poverty alleviation strategies.

**Research Excellence and Innovation**

Dr. Arowolo's research portfolio demonstrates exceptional originality and methodological innovation. His work on media coverage of social investment programs and poverty discourse has yielded significant scholarly outputs, with his publications in Q2 journals accumulating 262 citations on Google Scholar—a remarkable achievement for an early-career researcher. His methodological innovation in developing cross-cultural analytical frameworks positions him as a pioneer in comparative media studies, particularly in UK-Africa research contexts.

His current research agenda encompasses nine interconnected streams that directly address UK societal challenges, including:
- UK-Nigeria comparative media studies examining poverty discourse
- AI and journalism ethics research
- Digital democracy and computational communication
- Science communication and public engagement

**International Recognition and Leadership**

Dr. Arowolo has established himself as an emerging leader with significant international recognition. His role as a Digital Champion with Digital Kent demonstrates his commitment to addressing the UK's digital skills crisis, particularly in addressing Medway's 23% below-average digital skills rate. Through his innovative Research Africa platform (researchafrica.pub), he has created a groundbreaking digital infrastructure that bridges the systemic divide between African scholarship and global academic infrastructure—an initiative that has received extensive media coverage across Nigeria.

His exceptional communication skills were recognized through the University of Kent 3-Minute Thesis (3MT) Runner-up Award, demonstrating his outstanding ability to communicate complex research to non-specialist audiences—a crucial skill for academic leadership and public engagement.

**Teaching Excellence and Mentorship**

With over seven years of international teaching experience at university and college levels, Dr. Arowolo has demonstrated exceptional pedagogical innovation. His teaching roles at the University of Kent, East Kent College, and numerous schools across Kent have consistently yielded measurable improvements in student engagement and outcomes. Notably, his work at East Kent College resulted in a 76% improvement in student engagement and grades through innovative curriculum design that integrated real-world media scenarios.

His commitment to education extends beyond formal teaching through his extensive work as a cover supervisor and mentor, having positively impacted thousands of students across 14 schools in Kent. This demonstrates not only his teaching excellence but also his dedication to the UK education system and community development.

**Technical Innovation and Industry Impact**

Dr. Arowolo possesses a unique combination of academic rigor and practical technical expertise. His proficiency spans industry-standard software including Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve, combined with cutting-edge skills in AI-driven content creation, VR/AR applications, and cybersecurity. This technical expertise directly addresses the UK Government's Industrial Strategy priorities for the Creative Industries sector, which targets £31 billion investment by 2035.

His work with the University of Kent's Docking Station—a multi-million-pound initiative to build digital capability—positions him at the forefront of translating cutting-edge research into practical community applications. Through targeted workshops and training programs, he is directly contributing to the UK's creative sector job growth target of 40% by 2027.

**Research Impact and Policy Relevance**

Dr. Arowolo's research directly addresses critical UK societal issues while maintaining global relevance. His planned UK-Nigeria comparative study on media framing of poverty and social investment will provide crucial insights for UK policy development, particularly in areas where 30% of children live in poverty (such as Medway). His collaborative approach with NGOs, think tanks, and government organizations ensures his research translates into actionable policy recommendations.

His strategic partnerships with organizations such as Oxfam GB, NSPCC, and Plan International UK position the UK as a global leader in development communication research, directly contributing to the £65 billion professional services target by 2035.

**Future Contributions to UK Research Leadership**

Dr. Arowolo's vision extends to establishing the UK as the global center for development communication research through:
- Founding and directing the Global South Media Research Hub
- Mentoring 15+ UK PhD students in computational communication research
- Creating sustainable funding models combining university, council, and industry resources
- Developing the UK-Nigeria Media Research Consortium at the University of Kent

These initiatives will generate high-impact scholarly outputs, innovative research infrastructure, and strategic partnerships that strengthen the UK's position as a global leader in media and democracy research.

**Conclusion**

Dr. Arowolo represents exceptional talent that combines academic excellence, practical innovation, and community impact. His unique blend of scholarly achievement, technical expertise, and proven leadership makes him ideally positioned to make significant and lasting contributions to the UK's academic and creative sectors. His commitment to advancing media education and research aligns perfectly with the goals of the UK Exceptional Talent visa, and I am confident he will drive positive change through collaborative research and impactful teaching.

Given his sustained record of exceptional achievement, international standing, and clear vision for future contributions to UK research leadership, I strongly and unequivocally support Dr. Arowolo's application for the Global Talent visa. I am convinced he will make transformative contributions to the UK's academic community and broader society.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further information.
