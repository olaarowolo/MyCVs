Subject: British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship - Media, Poverty & Democracy Research Collaboration

Dear Professor Kaapa,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Olasunkanmi Arowolo, and I am a recent PhD graduate in Journalism from the University of Kent. I am writing to express my interest in applying for the British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Warwick, and I would be honored to have you as my academic mentor for this proposed research.

**Research Proposal: Media, Poverty & Democracy in UK-Nigeria Context**
My project, "Media, Poverty, and Democracy: A Comparative Analysis of Social Investment Discourse in the UK and Nigeria," directly builds on my PhD research examining media narratives around Nigeria's National Social Investment Programmes. This comparative study will investigate how media framing of poverty and social investment policies shapes democratic accountability and public engagement across these two politically distinct yet democratically comparable settings.

**Specific Alignment with Your Expertise**
Your research profile makes you uniquely suited to mentor this project:

**Research Expertise:**
- Your extensive work on media policy and industry practices, particularly your focus on the dynamics between media industries and consumers, directly aligns with my comparative analysis of UK-Nigeria media policy frameworks
- Your publications on environmental management of media and sustainable film policy provide crucial theoretical grounding for examining social investment discourse in media coverage
- Your expertise in transnational media studies offers valuable perspective for my UK-Nigeria comparative framework

**Teaching Alignment:**
- Your "Media, Policy and Markets" module addresses exactly the policy-media dynamics I will examine in both UK welfare coverage and Nigerian social investment reporting
- Your "Approaching Global Media" module provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how global media narratives shape local poverty discourse
- Your focus on sociological and cultural approaches to global media aligns with my methodology for analyzing cross-cultural media framing

**Research Methodology & Mentorship Value**
The study will employ comparative content analysis, critical discourse analysis, and elite interviews - methodologies that align with your established research approaches. Your guidance would be particularly valuable in:
- Refining the comparative framework between UK and Nigerian media contexts
- Developing the discourse analysis methodology for cross-cultural media studies
- Connecting the research to broader debates on media policy and democratic accountability

**Expected Contributions & Impact**
- Development of a typology of poverty discourse in legacy and digital news platforms
- Policy-relevant insights for journalists and policymakers in both countries
- Digital dashboard for public engagement beyond academia
- Alignment with British Academy priorities in tackling inequality and strengthening democracy

**Next Steps**
I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you in more detail. Your expertise in media policy, global media studies, and comparative research methodologies would be invaluable in refining this research design.

Would you be available for a brief meeting or video call in the coming weeks to discuss this potential collaboration? I'm flexible with scheduling and happy to accommodate your availability.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
