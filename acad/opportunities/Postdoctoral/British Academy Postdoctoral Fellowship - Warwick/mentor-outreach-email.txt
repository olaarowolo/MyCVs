Subject: British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship - Collaboration Opportunity on Media, Poverty & Democracy Research

Dear Professor Kaapa,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Olasunkanmi Arowolo, and I am a recent PhD graduate in Journalism from the University of Kent. I am writing to express my interest in applying for the British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Warwick, and I would be honoured to have you as my academic mentor for this proposed research.

**Research Proposal Overview**
My project, titled "Media, Poverty, and Democracy: A Comparative Analysis of Social Investment Discourse in the UK and Nigeria," builds directly on my PhD research examining media narratives around Nigeria's National Social Investment Programmes. This comparative study will investigate how media framing of poverty and social investment policies shapes democratic accountability and public engagement in both the UK and Nigeria.

**Alignment with Your Expertise**
Your extensive research on media policy and industry practices, particularly your work on media policy and markets, and your teaching on "Media, Policy and Markets" and "Approaching Global Media" modules, make you an ideal mentor for this interdisciplinary project. Your focus on the dynamics between media industries and consumers, as well as your sociological and cultural approach to global media, aligns well with the comparative UK-Nigeria framework of my research.

**Research Methodology**
The study will employ:
- Comparative content analysis of major news outlets (2015-2025)
- Critical discourse analysis of welfare reporting
- Elite interviews with 15-20 journalists, policy experts, and NGO advocates
- Development of a digital dashboard tracking cross-country media discourse trends

**Expected Contributions**
- Typology of media frames around social investment programmes
- Cross-cultural insights into poverty discourse politicization
- Policy-relevant outputs for media professionals and social policy actors
- Digital dashboard for public engagement beyond academia

**Timeline & Support**
The 24-month fellowship would begin in the 2025/26 academic year, with key milestones including literature review, data collection across both countries, analysis, and dissemination through academic publications and policy briefings.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you in more detail. Your guidance would be invaluable in refining the research design and ensuring the project's alignment with Warwick's research strengths in media and communication studies.

Would you be available for a brief meeting or video call in the coming weeks to discuss this potential collaboration? I'm flexible with scheduling and happy to accommodate your availability.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
