Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Application for Communications Intern Position

I am writing to express my interest in the Communications Intern role at the Royal Society of Biology, as advertised. With a strong background in communications, media management, and event support, combined with my passion for biology and science communication, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the delivery and evaluation of the 2025 Biology Week.

My experience as a communications professional and academic has equipped me with the skills necessary to support the RSB’s Communications and Public Affairs team effectively. For example, I have developed and delivered targeted social media campaigns that increased engagement and awareness among diverse audiences, which aligns with the role’s requirement to assist in running social media campaigns supporting biology and the biosciences. Additionally, I have created communication resources and educational materials tailored for different audiences, demonstrating my ability to write and prepare activity support resources as outlined in the job description.

In my role as a Lecturer and Assistant Lecturer, I have honed my organisational skills and attention to detail, ensuring that projects and events are delivered successfully and on time. I have also collaborated with colleagues and mentored students, reflecting my strong team-working and collaborative skills. My proactive approach and willingness to learn new skills will enable me to adapt to the fast-paced and evolving environment at the RSB.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the RSB’s commitment to advancing education, professional development, and public engagement in the life sciences. I share these values and am eager to contribute to inspiring and uniting individuals and organisations in support of biology. Furthermore, my recent scholarship to attend the Association of British Science Writers Summer School 2025, which takes place on 26 June, will deepened my understanding of science storytelling and digital media, which I believe will be valuable in supporting Biology Week activities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of the Royal Society of Biology.

Yours faithfully,  
Sunday Olasunkanmi Arowolo
