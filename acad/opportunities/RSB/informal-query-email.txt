Subject: Informal Query Regarding the Communications Intern Role

Dear Amanda Hardy,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my interest in the Communications Intern position at the Royal Society of Biology and to seek some informal guidance regarding the role. I have reviewed the job description and am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to the Communications and Public Affairs team, particularly in supporting the 2025 Biology Week activities.

Could you please provide any additional insights about the day-to-day responsibilities or the team environment? Additionally, I would appreciate any advice on how best to tailor my application to align with the RSB’s values and expectations.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
