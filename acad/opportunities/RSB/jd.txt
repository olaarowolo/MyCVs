The RSB is a single unified voice for biology: advising Government and influencing policy; advancing education and professional development; supporting our members, and engaging and encouraging public interest in the life sciences.

We are looking for an Intern to support the delivery and evaluation of one of the RSB's flagship annual events, the 2025 Biology Week. This internship will offer the successful candidate the opportunity to gain skills in event organisation and communication, as well as experience in a fast-paced office environment working with multiple teams. RSB is a virtual organisation, so the role is home based with some travel to London (for which travel expenses will be paid). 

In addition to face-to-face Biology Week events, the intern will also write and prepare Biology Week activity support resources for different audiences to help them plan, run and promote their own events and activities.

We are looking for someone who is positive, innovative, willing to learn and passionate about biology. Experience of science communication is an advantage, as is a bioscience degree or equivalent.

Due to the nature of some of the Biology Week events you must be able to work occasional evenings where required and you must be over 18 years of age and be legally able to work full-time in the UK.

How to apply
Create a free mySociety account on the RSB website and submit a CV (2 page max) and covering letter (1 page max) outlining your suitability for the post in line with the job description and person specification. 
Applications will close 22 June 2025. Interviews will be held 2 or 3 July 2025. 

The RSB is committed to ensuring equal opportunities in the life sciences, and supports diversity throughout lifetimes at school and higher education, in the workplace and training; we value diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive culture.
