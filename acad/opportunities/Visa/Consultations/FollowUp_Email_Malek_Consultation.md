# Follow-up email draft — consultation (Global Talent)

**Subject:** Follow-up on today’s consultation — next steps and payment

Hi [Name],

Thank you again for the consultation calls earlier today (morning and evening). I appreciate your enthusiastic feedback on the form submission and the direction we discussed.

## Agreed next steps

- I will compile and share additional **public links**/online references for the work completed (publications, policy briefs, official pages, citations) so the evidence is easier to verify and map to the endorsement criteria.
- Please confirm your preferred format for sharing these (e.g., a table with: title, URL, date, my role, and which criterion it supports).

## Fee and availability

- I confirm we agreed the **consultation fee is 150** and is **non-refundable**, and that this was communicated clearly.
- I also understand that the **pro-bono slot allocation for this month has been exhausted**, and we will proceed on the paid basis moving forward.

## Payment

Payment can be made to either:

**My Revolut account**

I’ve included the bank details below.
