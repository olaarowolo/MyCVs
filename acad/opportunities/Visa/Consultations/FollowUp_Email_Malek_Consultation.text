Subject: Follow-up on today’s consultation — next steps and payment

Hi Malek,

Thank you for your time today for the consultation drop-in. Based on the information you shared and the submission completed, I’m encouraged by your potential fit for the route, subject to strengthening the evidence pack.

Scope and expectations
- This engagement is strictly strategic guidance on positioning, evidence coherence, endorsing-body alignment, referee strategy, and timing.
- It is not an application-writing service and does not include drafting recommendation letters.
- It is not legal or immigration advice, and no endorsement/visa outcome can be guaranteed.
- For clarity, the service scope and process are set out here: https://olaarowolo.com/global-talent

Next steps
- Payment is the next step. Once payment is confirmed, I will share the folder structure and file/evidence management approach for how to compile and label your documents.
- You will then upload/share your evidence in a structured folder which I will share with you after confirmation of step 1.
- After that, we will schedule a formal, extensive consultation (1-hour session) to review all evidence, identify gaps, and finalise priorities.
- Following the 1-hour review, we will activate a structured action plan (with clear milestones) to strengthen your portfolio—evidence mapping to criteria, referee strategy, gap-filling items, and a week-by-week schedule to readiness.

Fee and availability
- As agreed, the consultation fee is 150 and is non-refundable, and this has been communicated clearly.
- The pro-bono slot allocation for this month has been exhausted; we will proceed on the paid basis moving forward.
