National or International Recognition:	International Level
Intended Route:	Exceptional Promise
Proposed Endorsing Body:	British Academy
Previous Global Talent Exploration/Application:	Yes - Researching
Independent Referees Status:	Identified Only
Evidence Portfolio Readiness:	Gathering evidence
Intended Application Timeline:	Immediate / 1 month
Reason for Considering this Route:	Over the past years, I have focused my research and policy advisory on the African region, building a robust portfolio in climate resilience and sustainable development. I have now reached a critical juncture where I aim to scale my impact by influencing international climate policy architecture—specifically regarding the Climate Adaptation and Loss and Damage nexus. I believe the UK is the premier global hub to facilitate this transition. By relocating, I seek to leverage the UK's unparalleled academic and policy networks, such as Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. These institutions provide the ideal platform for high-level collaboration with world-leading researchers. My goal is to act as a strategic bridge, fostering meaningful cooperation between the Global South and the Global North. I intend to bring my first-hand experience as a negotiator for the African Group and Tunisia into the UK research ecosystem to ensure that global climate policies are equitable, data-driven, and representative of the most vulnerable regions. Applying via Route 4 allows me the professional independence to integrate into these elite networks and contribute to the UK’s standing as a leader in international climate justice.

============================================================
SAVED REVIEW (FOR INTERNAL USE) — GLOBAL TALENT (UK) / BRITISH ACADEMY
============================================================
Date:	[add date]
Candidate:	Malek Romdhane
Route:	Exceptional Promise (proposed)
Endorsing body:	British Academy (proposed)
Primary profile:	Climate policy / sustainability specialist with UNFCCC negotiation track record and policy implementation experience.

1) Overall suitability (high-level)
- Likely credible for Global Talent (Promise) under British Academy if the application is framed as internationally recognised social science / policy expertise with clear, attributable impact.
- Strongest angle: leadership and influence in international climate governance (UNFCCC) + published outputs with UN recognition + demonstrable policy development deliverables.
- Main risk: evidence needs to be packaged as “independent recognition” and “significant contributions” with verifiable attribution (not just participation), and aligned to British Academy’s arts/humanities/social science remit.

Indicative outcome:
- Promise: Moderate-to-strong potential if evidence is curated and independently validated.
- Talent: Not advised at this stage unless there is stronger, sustained global recognition (major prizes/competitive grants, senior leadership in global institutions, highly selective appointments, or high-impact publication record).

2) Strengths to emphasise (what already reads well)
A. International standing through formal roles
- Formal national UNFCCC Party negotiator (multiple COPs + SB sessions). This is unusually strong for mid-career and supports “leadership” and “influence” if you document roles, mandates, and interventions.

B. Independent, external recognition
- Chevening (highly competitive) supports recognition/leadership potential.
- UN-related recognition (“Climate Champion”) can help if it is clearly an official designation and not informal.

C. Published/endorsed outputs and citations
- UN Geneva publication is strong, especially if you can show selection/commissioning and dissemination.
- Policy citations help; the best evidence is where your work is cited by respected institutions or used in official processes.

D. Policy implementation impact
- Delivery of national competency frameworks and digital inclusion strategy advice are strong if you can prove adoption, funding, or rollout and your personal authorship/contribution.

3) Key gaps / risks (what could weaken an endorsement decision)
A. Attribution and “how you were exceptional”
- Negotiation participation alone can be interpreted as role-based. You need evidence showing you led, drafted, secured text, or shaped positions/outcomes.

B. British Academy fit
- BA typically expects a clear connection to social sciences/humanities: governance, policy analysis, political economy, development studies, migration studies, gender, education, etc.
- The application should read like a social scientist/policy researcher with rigorous methods and credible outputs, not primarily as a general consultant.

C. Portfolio readiness and timeline
- Stated readiness is “gathering evidence” with a 1-month timeline; this is ambitious unless referees and documentary evidence are already lined up.

D. Publications profile (if aiming beyond Promise)
- BA decisions often lean toward applicants with peer-reviewed or academically recognised outputs; policy reports can work, but must be framed as high-impact and independently validated.

4) Evidence mapping (suggested portfolio structure)
Primary Mandatory Criterion (MC): recognition as a leader / potential leader
Use 2–3 items such as:
- Official proof of UNFCCC negotiator appointment + evidence of leadership (agenda roles, interventions, invited statements, chairing/co-facilitation, authored submissions).
- Chevening award letter + description of selection competitiveness.
- Official UN/ministerial recognition (Climate Champion) with context and third-party corroboration.

Optional Criterion 1 (OC1): significant contributions to the field
Use 2–3 items such as:
- National competency frameworks: contracts/ToR + final deliverables + ministerial adoption letter, implementation plan, or official reference.
- Togo digital inclusion strategy: deliverable + ministry confirmation letter detailing impact and your role.
- Loss and Damage Collaboration: evidence of your strategic outputs shaping organisational or external policy positions (signed/dated briefs, stakeholder feedback, uptake).

Optional Criterion 2 (OC2): academic or policy research excellence
Use 2–3 items such as:
- UN Geneva publication: commissioning/selection email + publication link + download stats/coverage if available.
- Evidence of citations/use in official or respected policy documents; highlight third-party citations, not self-references.
- IOM conference/key messages: show your authorship (tracked changes, acknowledgement, invitation as contributor) and how it influenced the declaration/process.

5) Referee strategy (critical)
You need 3 letters; recommend:
- 1 senior academic (UK or internationally recognised) in climate governance/development/migration/gender policy.
- 1 senior official / diplomat who can validate UNFCCC negotiator role and concrete contributions (ideally ministry/UNFCCC focal point).
- 1 senior leader from an international organisation/think tank/NGO who can confirm impact, leadership, and independence.
Each letter should:
- Be on letterhead, signed, dated, include contact details.
- State how long and in what capacity they know you.
- Give 2–3 concrete examples of your leadership and impact (with outcomes).
- Compare you to peers internationally (for Promise: “top X% among emerging/mid-career professionals”).

6) Tighten claims (quick fixes before submission)
- Ensure COP range is accurate (COP25–28 already occurred; COP29/30 should not be presented as past attendance). If future participation is expected, label as “expected/confirmed” with proof.
- Replace broad terms (“expert”, “prestigious”, “top 2%”) with verifiable statements or remove if unprovable.
- Convert activities into outcomes: adopted frameworks, referenced texts, policy changes, funded initiatives, invitations to advise, speaking roles, etc.

7) 30-day action plan (if applying in ~1 month)
Week 1:
- Lock endorsing body rationale (British Academy) with a clear social science/policy framing.
- Select 8–10 strongest evidence items; request missing corroboration letters.
Week 2:
- Secure 3 referees; provide them a one-page brief of achievements + draft bullet points.
- Collect official appointment letters, contracts/ToR, proof of authorship, and adoption/impact evidence.
Week 3:
- Draft personal statement focused on: climate governance impact, methodology, leadership, UK plan.
- Write evidence summaries (what, your role, why it matters, independent proof).
Week 4:
- Finalise and quality-control: consistency, dates, third-party corroboration, British Academy alignment.

8) Recommendation
Proceed under Exceptional Promise if you can (a) evidence specific influence within UNFCCC/policy processes, and (b) secure strong independent referee letters that explicitly endorse your international leadership potential and impact.
