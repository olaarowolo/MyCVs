# Saved Review (Internal Use) — Global Talent (UK) / British Academy

- **Date:** [add date]
- **Candidate:** Malek Romdhane
- **Route:** Exceptional Promise (proposed)
- **Endorsing body:** British Academy (proposed)
- **Primary profile:** Climate policy / sustainability specialist with UNFCCC negotiation track record and policy implementation experience.

## 1) Overall suitability (high-level)

- Likely credible for Global Talent (Promise) under British Academy if the application is framed as internationally recognised **social science / policy** expertise with clear, attributable impact.
- Strongest angle: leadership and influence in international climate governance (UNFCCC) + published outputs with UN recognition + demonstrable policy development deliverables.
- Main risk: evidence must be packaged as **independent recognition** and **significant contributions** with verifiable attribution (not just participation), and aligned to British Academy’s arts/humanities/social science remit.

**Indicative outcome**

- **Promise:** Moderate-to-strong potential if evidence is curated and independently validated.
- **Talent:** Not advised at this stage unless there is stronger, sustained global recognition (e.g., major prizes/competitive grants, senior leadership in global institutions, highly selective appointments, or high-impact publication record).

## 2) Strengths to emphasise (what already reads well)

### A. International standing through formal roles

- Formal national UNFCCC Party negotiator (multiple COPs + SB sessions). Unusually strong for mid-career and supports “leadership” and “influence” if you document roles, mandates, and interventions.

### B. Independent, external recognition

- Chevening (highly competitive) supports recognition/leadership potential.
- UN-related recognition (“Climate Champion”) can help if it is clearly an official designation and not informal.

### C. Published/endorsed outputs and citations

- UN Geneva publication is strong, especially if you can show selection/commissioning and dissemination.
- Policy citations help; best evidence is where your work is cited by respected institutions or used in official processes.

### D. Policy implementation impact

- Delivery of national competency frameworks and digital inclusion strategy advice are strong if you can prove adoption, funding, or rollout and your personal authorship/contribution.

## 3) Key gaps / risks (what could weaken an endorsement decision)

### A. Attribution and “how you were exceptional”

- Negotiation participation alone can be interpreted as role-based. You need evidence showing you led, drafted, secured text, or shaped positions/outcomes.

### B. British Academy fit

- BA typically expects a clear connection to social sciences/humanities: governance, policy analysis, political economy, development studies, migration studies, gender, education, etc.
- The application should read like a social scientist/policy researcher with rigorous methods and credible outputs, not primarily as a general consultant.

### C. Portfolio readiness and timeline

- Portfolio readiness stated as “gathering evidence” with a 1-month timeline is ambitious unless referees and documentary evidence are already lined up.

### D. Publications profile (if aiming beyond Promise)

- BA decisions often lean toward applicants with peer-reviewed or academically recognised outputs; policy reports can work, but must be framed as high-impact and independently validated.

## 4) Evidence mapping (suggested portfolio structure)

### Mandatory Criterion (MC): recognition as a leader / potential leader

Use 2–3 items such as:

- Official proof of UNFCCC negotiator appointment + evidence of leadership (agenda roles, interventions, invited statements, chairing/co-facilitation, authored submissions).
- Chevening award letter + explanation of selection competitiveness.
- Official UN/ministerial recognition (Climate Champion) with context and third-party corroboration.

### Optional Criterion 1 (OC1): significant contributions to the field

Use 2–3 items such as:

- National competency frameworks: contracts/ToR + final deliverables + ministerial adoption letter, implementation plan, or official reference.
- Togo digital inclusion strategy: deliverable + ministry confirmation letter detailing impact and your role.
- Loss and Damage Collaboration: evidence of your strategic outputs shaping organisational or external policy positions (signed/dated briefs, stakeholder feedback, uptake).

### Optional Criterion 2 (OC2): academic or policy research excellence

Use 2–3 items such as:

- UN Geneva publication: commissioning/selection email + publication link + download stats/coverage if available.
- Evidence of citations/use in official or respected policy documents; highlight third-party citations, not self-references.
- IOM conference/key messages: show your authorship (tracked changes, acknowledgement, invitation as contributor) and how it influenced the declaration/process.

## 5) Referee strategy (critical)

You need **3 letters**; recommended mix:

- 1 senior academic (UK or internationally recognised) in climate governance/development/migration/gender policy.
- 1 senior official / diplomat who can validate UNFCCC negotiator role and concrete contributions (ideally ministry/UNFCCC focal point).
- 1 senior leader from an international organisation/think tank/NGO who can confirm impact, leadership, and independence.

Each letter should:

- Be on letterhead, signed, dated, include contact details.
- State how long and in what capacity they know you.
- Provide 2–3 concrete examples of your leadership and impact (with outcomes).
- Compare you to peers internationally (for Promise: “top X% among emerging/mid-career professionals”).

## 6) Tighten claims (quick fixes before submission)

- Ensure COP range is accurate (COP25–28 already occurred; COP29/30 should not be presented as past attendance). If future participation is expected, label as “expected/confirmed” with proof.
- Replace broad terms (“expert”, “prestigious”, “top 2%”) with verifiable statements or remove if unprovable.
- Convert activities into outcomes: adopted frameworks, referenced texts, policy changes, funded initiatives, invitations to advise, speaking roles, etc.

## 7) 30-day action plan (if applying in ~1 month)

**Week 1**

- Lock endorsing body rationale (British Academy) with a clear social science/policy framing.
- Select 8–10 strongest evidence items; request missing corroboration letters.

**Week 2**

- Secure 3 referees; provide them a one-page brief of achievements + draft bullet points.
- Collect official appointment letters, contracts/ToR, proof of authorship, and adoption/impact evidence.

**Week 3**

- Draft personal statement focused on: climate governance impact, methodology, leadership, UK plan.
- Write evidence summaries (what, your role, why it matters, independent proof).

**Week 4**

- Finalise and quality-control: consistency, dates, third-party corroboration, British Academy alignment.

## 8) Recommendation

Proceed under **Exceptional Promise** if you can:

- Evidence specific influence within UNFCCC/policy processes, and
- Secure strong independent referee letters that explicitly endorse your international leadership potential and impact.
