These qualifications have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of media theories, communication practices, and research methodologies.

Teaching and Mentoring Experience

My teaching roles at the University of Kent and other institutions have enabled me to design and deliver innovative curricula that bridge theory and practice, fostering critical thinking and technical proficiency among students. I have taught a wide range of modules, including Studying Journalism, Social Policy, Sociology, and Communication Studies, tailoring my approach to meet diverse student needs. Beyond formal teaching, I have served as a personal tutor and mentor, providing pastoral care and academic guidance to support student development and well-being.

Research Contributions and Publications

My research focuses on the intersection of media, communication, and social change, with particular attention to the role of the press and digital platforms in shaping public discourse. I have contributed to peer-reviewed journals, academic conferences, and collaborative projects that explore themes such as media framing, digital activism, and the socio-political impact of media narratives. I have publish in reputable and highly ranked Q2 journals and my research outputs have received significant growing citations with currently 259 citations on Google Scholar  and  Notably, my doctoral thesis investigates the role of the press and Twittersphere in Nigeria’s National Social Investment Programmes, highlighting the power of media in influencing policy and public opinion.

This blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise allows me to deliver comprehensive media education that prepares students for the evolving demands of the industry.


Research Equity Innovation

One of my recent innovations is the development of Research Africa (https://researchafrica.pub , https://researchafricapublications.com), a digital platform dedicated to promoting and preserving African academic content. This initiative addresses the systemic and structural divide between African scholarship and the global academic infrastructure, ensuring that the valuable work of African scholars is recognised and accessible worldwide.

Research Africa plays a crucial role in digitising African academic content, making it available to both local and diaspora researchers. By integrating African scholarship within international research repositories and standards, this platform helps bridge the knowledge gap and fosters a more inclusive academic environment.

Through Research Africa, I aim to amplify the voices of African scholars and provide them with the tools and resources needed to contribute to the global academic community. This innovation not only enhances the visibility of African research but also promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing across borders. This innovation has received media mentions from national new media in Nigeria such as Premium Times, The Nation, Vanguard, DevReporting, among others.

I have demonstrated leadership through roles such as a Director of Photography at OA MediaKraft, where I oversee creative direction and production quality. Additionally, I have managed editorial and business operations for academic journals, contributing to the dissemination of scholarly work and fostering academic communities. My commitment to service extends to mentoring students and young professionals, supporting their career development and encouraging engagement with media as a tool for social impact.

Passion and Vision

My passion lies in advancing media education and research that not only equips learners with technical skills but also empowers them to use media as a catalyst for social change and public discourse. I am deeply committed to fostering inclusivity, innovation, and excellence in media and communication studies. I envision contributing to the UK’s vibrant academic and media sectors by developing cutting-edge curricula, leading impactful research, and collaborating with industry and community partners to address contemporary challenges.
