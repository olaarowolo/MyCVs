**Dear Deputy Vice-Chancellor,**

I write with unreserved enthusiasm to endorse Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo for the UK Global Talent Visa under the exceptional talent route. Having supervised his groundbreaking doctoral research at Kent, I can attest that he represents the pinnacle of academic excellence and societal impact that this visa category seeks to attract.

**World-Leading Research Excellence**

Dr. Arowolo's doctoral thesis stands as a strong foundation upon which to build a comparative media studies which will be a unique and the only UK research systematically analyzing UK-Nigeria media policy frameworks for poverty discourse. His methodological innovation in developing cross-cultural analytical frameworks, when developed could be adopted by UK universities for their research programs. These work's immediate relevance to UK policy is evidenced by direct briefings he has provided to FCDO, DWP, and DCMS on media regulation and development communication strategies.

**Immediate Societal Impact**

What distinguishes Dr. Arowolo is his translation of research into tangible societal benefit. His mentoring programs have directly impacted 500+ UK students, with 85% achieving improved academic outcomes and 70% progressing to higher education. At East Kent College alone, his purposeful learning interventions improved student engagement by 76% - a measurable disruption of educational inequality cycles that aligns precisely with UK social mobility priorities.

**Strategic Vision for UK Leadership**

Dr. Arowolo's 5-year plan demonstrates exceptional promise through:

- **Long-term (2028-30)**: Creation of £2M endowment for permanent UK-Nigeria research chair, cementing Kent's global leadership in comparative media studies

**Unparalleled Network Value**

His established networks across UK government, media, and education sectors provide immediate value. Current partnerships include BBC World Service (editorial standards training), Guardian Foundation (journalism fellowship curriculum), and direct advisory roles to Chatham House and ODI. These connections will amplify Kent's research impact and funding opportunities exponentially.
