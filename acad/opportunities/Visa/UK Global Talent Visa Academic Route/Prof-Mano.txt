Reference for Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo – British Academy Exceptional Talent Visa Application

I am pleased to provide a reference for Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo in support of his application for endorsement under the British Academy’s Global Talent route. I am Professor of Journalism at the Communication and Media Research Institute (CAMRI), University of Westminster. While I have not worked closely with Dr. Arowolo, I have reviewed his research and was previously considered as a potential external examiner for his PhD, which provides an independent basis for assessing the quality, relevance, and impact of his scholarship.

Dr. Arowolo’s doctoral research, Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria’s Social Investment Programmes, demonstrates rigorous comparative analysis of Nigerian and UK media, examining the influence of media narratives on public understanding of poverty and social policy. His work bridges academic research with practical impact, evidenced by peer-reviewed publications, national media coverage, and policy-relevant insights.

Beyond his doctoral research, Dr. Arowolo combines expertise in traditional and digital media production with digital innovation, including AI-driven content, VR/AR applications, and immersive storytelling. This positions him to support the UK’s Creative Industries growth priorities, enhance regional digital skills, and develop next-generation creative talent. In Medway, he contributes directly to the University of Kent Docking Station and Digital Kent initiatives, providing training and guidance that addresses local digital skills gaps and promotes scalable creative-tech capacity building.

Dr. Arowolo’s research, publications, and public engagement reflect an exceptional ability to generate societal and economic impact. His strategic partnerships with organisations such as Oxfam GB, NSPCC, and Plan International UK, and his Research Africa platform, demonstrate capacity to translate research into actionable frameworks that support the UK’s creative and professional services sectors. His work strengthens the UK’s position as a global hub for development communication research while delivering measurable benefits in education, policy, and creative innovation.

On the basis of his academic achievements, technical expertise, and regional and national impact, I assess Dr. Arowolo as an outstanding candidate for the British Academy’s Exceptional Talent endorsement. I fully support his application.

Yours sincerely,
Professor Winston Mano
