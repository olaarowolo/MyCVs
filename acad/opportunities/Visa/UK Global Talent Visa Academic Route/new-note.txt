National/Policy Link
Building on my academic foundation, I bring extensive practical experience and digital innovation expertise to media production. The UK Government’s Industrial Strategy identifies the Creative Industries as one of five key growth sectors driving the economy. This expansion demands a skilled workforce capable of navigating emerging technologies and delivering innovative media solutions. My expertise spans traditional media production: writing, directing, camera operation, lighting, audio, editing, visual effects, and colour grading across film, television, journalism, and radio; as well as cutting-edge digital innovation in immersive storytelling technologies. I develop solutions that bridge conventional media with emerging platforms, including VR/AR applications, interactive media experiences, and AI-driven content creation tools. Proficient in industry-standard software such as Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro, Figma, CorelDRAW, DaVinci Resolve, and OBS. I combine theory and practice to prepare future professionals through teaching, research, and public engagement, equipping them with the critical skills and digital literacy essential to sustaining and growing the creative economy.
Regional Impact
In Medway, the University of Kent’s Docking Station represents a multi-million-pound push to build digital capability and prepare communities for an AI-driven economy. As a Digital Champion with Digital Kent, a Medway Council initiative, and a specialist in media production and technical consultancy, I contribute directly to this vision.
My role includes advising on the integration of advanced media technologies and leading targeted workshops. These will translate Docking Station’s industry-grade tools into accessible community training, adapt motion-capture techniques for local creative firms and schools, and apply digital storytelling frameworks to heritage projects. I will also design courses to prepare residents for creative-tech careers, promote safe adoption of new technologies through web development and cybersecurity, and create scalable training models to extend the Docking Station’s reach.
The goal is to raise digital literacy so local communities can capitalise on the economic and cultural opportunities of the creative industries. This includes addressing Medway’s 23% below-average digital skills rate, supporting the council’s target of 40% creative-sector job growth by 2027, and ensuring benefits reach well beyond the Docking Station’s physical site.
 
Addressing Skills Shortfalls
The UK faces a persistent shortfall in digital literacy, with large sections of the workforce unprepared for the demands of a technology-led economy. My professional and academic background; across AI applications, data ethics, media production, and digital governance, positions me to help close this gap.
Through higher education teaching, industry partnerships, and public workshops, I deliver training that equips learners with the skills and critical understanding to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. By combining hands-on technical expertise with strategic insight, I ensure that training not only meets current needs but anticipates future demands.
Research for Social Impact
My doctoral research, Poverty, Politics, and the Press, provides deep insights into the relationship between media, poverty, and social policy, with findings already attracting national media coverage in The Sun, Vanguard, and Premium Times. These insights are directly relevant to UK efforts to address poverty—particularly in areas such as Medway, where around 30% of children live in poverty, well above the South East average of 25%, and where digital skills lag 23% below the national level.
By combining rigorous academic research with practical outreach, I can contribute evidence-based strategies to help NGOs, think tanks, and local authorities tackle poverty, improve public discourse, and counter misinformation. My track record, spanning peer-reviewed publications, policy-relevant comparative research between the UK and Nigeria, and initiatives such as founding Research Africa to amplify underrepresented scholarship demonstrates my ability to produce work with both local and global impact. This positions me to strengthen the UK’s leadership in innovative, cross-cultural research that delivers tangible social and economic benefits.
Community and Wellbeing Contribution
Beyond research and teaching, I actively work to strengthen resilience, wellbeing and peer support in academic and creative circles. 
Through my YouTube doctoral journal, postgraduate mentoring, volunteering with Digital Kent, and as a John Maxwell-trained facilitator on the Beyond Success Programme, I guide individuals and teams through transformative leadership and personal growth journeys. These activities provide practical guidance to help colleagues overcome professional hurdles, maintain momentum, and develop transferable skills, fostering stronger networks, shared know-how, and a culture in which academics and creatives can flourish.
The impact is expected to my UK LinkedIn community and other social networks. The aim is not just individual growth but stronger networks, shared know-how and a culture in which academics and creatives can flourish. By investing in people and collective capacity, I help safeguard the long-term vitality and inventiveness of the UK’s academic and creative sectors.

Strategic Partnerships for UK Global Leadership in Development Communication Research
My positioning for partnerships with leading development and human rights organisations directly advances the UK’s Industrial Strategy objectives across the Creative Industries and Professional and Business Services sectors. Holding a rare PhD distinction - zero corrections, top 8% nationally and with growing research visibility and increasing citations, I offer Oxfam GB, NSPCC, Plan International UK, and similar organisations a pioneering UK-Nigeria comparative framework that transforms how media narratives shape poverty alleviation and child rights advocacy, directly contributing to the UK’s £31 billion creative industries investment target by 2035.

The Research Africa platform exemplifies innovation in bridging global scholarship gaps, reinforcing the UK as a hub for development communication research while supporting initiatives such as the Creative Content Exchange and Creative Industries R&D investment (£100M clusters + £25M Creative Futures). My ability to convert complex research into actionable strategies with demonstrated 76% engagement improvements ensures measurable, immediate impact, aligning with the Industrial Strategy’s goals of innovation adoption and resilient creative supply chains.

These partnerships position the UK as the global centre for development communication research, supporting sustained business growth (£65 billion professional services target by 2035) and international collaboration. By combining academic excellence with practical implementation, this work creates scalable frameworks that attract investment, develop next-generation creative talent, and deliver knowledge transfer across the Creative Industries and Professional and Business Services sectors.
