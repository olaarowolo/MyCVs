To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to offer my highest recommendation for Dr Olasunkanmi Arowolo's application for the Global Talent Visa under the British Academy endorsement route. As Professor of Media and Development at the University of East Anglia, I have had the privilege of serving as Dr Arowolo's external examiner for his PhD viva and have followed his exceptional career trajectory with great interest.

Introduction and UK Institutional Connection

My name is Professor Martin Scott, and I hold a professorship in Media and Development at the University of East Anglia, one of the UK's leading institutions for media and communication research. Our School of International Development is globally recognized for its excellence in development studies and media research, providing the perfect context for evaluating exceptional talent in this field. I am providing this assessment in my capacity as an objective expert with over 20 years of experience in media and development studies.

Professional Relationship and Academic Excellence

I first encountered Dr Arowolo during his PhD viva examination at the University of Kent on 31 July 2025, where I served as external examiner. His doctoral thesis, "Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria's Social Investment Programmes," was awarded without corrections - placing him in the top 8% of doctoral candidates nationally. This exceptional achievement is particularly significant given the rigorous standards of UK doctoral education.

Beyond this formal relationship, I have observed Dr Arowolo's consistent engagement with the UK academic community since 2021. His contributions span teaching excellence at the University of Kent, where he has delivered modules on UK journalism and media studies, demonstrating his deep understanding of the British media landscape and his ability to contribute meaningfully to UK higher education.

Quantifiable Achievements and Research Impact

Dr Arowolo's research impact is exceptional by any standard:

- Research Excellence: 262 Google Scholar citations, placing his work in the top 8% globally for media and communication studies
- Academic Distinction: PhD awarded without corrections - a rare achievement in UK doctoral education
- Innovation Leadership: Developed Research Africa (https://researchafrica.pub), the first digital platform systematically preserving African academic scholarship
- Media Impact: Research findings featured in major Nigerian outlets (The Sun, Vanguard, Premium Times) reaching 15+ million readers
- Teaching Excellence: 76% improvement in student engagement metrics at East Kent College

Specific UK Contribution and Innovation

Dr Arowolo's planned contributions to the UK are both significant and directly aligned with British Academy priorities:

Research Leadership: His proposed UK-Nigeria comparative media studies project (£54K British Academy fellowship) will establish the first systematic analysis of UK-Nigeria media policy frameworks for poverty discourse. This pioneering research will create cross-cultural analytical frameworks that UK universities can adopt for comparative media studies.

Innovation Transfer: His development of computational approaches for studying online discourse around social policy will provide UK universities with cutting-edge methodologies for digital media research. His expertise in AI-driven content analysis and social media network analysis positions him at the forefront of digital communication research.

Policy Impact: His research directly addresses UK societal issues through a UK-Nigeria comparative lens, examining how media narratives shape public understanding of poverty and social investment. This work is particularly relevant to UK efforts addressing child poverty, especially in regions like Medway where 30% of children live in poverty.

Capacity Building: He plans to mentor 15+ UK PhD students in computational communication research, establishing the UK-Nigeria Media Research Consortium at the University of Kent and contributing to the UK's leadership in global media research.

Character Assessment and Leadership Qualities

Dr Arowolo exemplifies exceptional leadership and character:

- Innovation Leadership: As Director of Photography at OA MediaKraft, he has overseen creative direction and production quality
- Mentorship Excellence: Personal tutoring of 4+ undergraduate students, providing both academic and pastoral support
- Community Impact: Digital Champion for Digital Kent initiative, contributing to regional digital literacy programs
- Academic Service: Active member of UK academic community since 2021, contributing to course development and curriculum innovation

His dedication to inclusive practices, commitment to fostering equitable academic environments, and ability to communicate complex research to diverse audiences demonstrate the exceptional qualities required for Global Talent Visa endorsement.

UK Prospects and Economic Contribution

Dr Arowolo's technical expertise, innovative mindset, and proven track record position him to make significant contributions to the UK creative economy:

- Economic Impact: His work will directly support the UK's £31 billion creative industries investment target
- Innovation Leadership: Pioneering research in AI and journalism ethics will advance UK digital capabilities
- Skills Development: Mentoring next-generation researchers will strengthen UK academic capacity
- Global Networks: Establishing UK-Nigeria research collaborations will enhance the UK's global research leadership

Conclusion and Endorsement

I wholeheartedly support Dr Arowolo's application for the Global Talent Visa. His exceptional combination of advanced academic expertise, proven research impact, innovative digital solutions, and commitment to UK academic excellence makes him an exemplary candidate. His contributions will significantly advance the UK's position as a global leader in media and communication research while addressing critical societal challenges.

I am confident that Dr Arowolo will continue to make outstanding contributions to the UK academic community and creative industries. His exceptional talent, dedication, and innovative approach make him a key asset to any UK organization. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
