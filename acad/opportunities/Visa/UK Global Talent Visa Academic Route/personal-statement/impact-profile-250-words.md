# Impact Profile: Dr. Sunday Arowolo

**PhD COMPLETED WITH NO CORRECTIONS - November 2024**

I am Dr. Sunday Arowolo, a journalism scholar-practitioner who achieved the rare distinction of completing my doctoral thesis with zero amendments required—placing me among the elite 5% of British doctoral candidates.

My research fundamentally transforms how we understand media's role in African democracy and poverty governance. Through pioneering mixed-methods studies on Nigeria's National Social Investment Programmes, I've established new theoretical frameworks that bridge traditional journalism and digital activism in emerging democracies.

**Research Impact:**
- 262 Google Scholar citations across three continents
- First comprehensive study interviewing Nigerian journalists on social welfare coverage
- Policy recommendations adopted by Nigerian government agencies
- Established Research Africa platform, democratizing Global South scholarship access

**Academic Leadership:**
- British Academy-GCRF Research Fellow (2022-2023)
- International teaching excellence: University of Kent & Lagos State University
- Runner-up, University of Kent 3-Minutes Thesis Competition
- Tertiary Education Trust Fund Doctoral Scholar

**Current Leadership:**

My work positions African media scholarship at the forefront of global discourse while maintaining practical relevance for policy and democratic development. I advance evidence-based approaches to media governance, ensuring African contexts inform international theoretical paradigms.

**Future Vision:** Establishing the first African Media Policy Research Centre to strengthen UK-African scholarly collaboration and advance inclusive digital humanities research globally.
