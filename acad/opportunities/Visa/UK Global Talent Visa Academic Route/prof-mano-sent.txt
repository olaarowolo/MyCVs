Reference for Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo – British Academy Exceptional Talent Visa Application
I am writing to provide a reference for Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo in support of his application for endorsement under the British Academy’s Global Talent route. I am Professor of Journalism at the Communication and Media Research Institute, University of Westminster. While I have not worked closely with Dr. Arowolo, I have reviewed his research. I was, at a stage, considered and listed as a potential external examiner for his PhD, which provides an independent basis for assessing the quality, relevance, and impact of his scholarship.
Dr. Arowolo’s doctoral research, Poverty, Politics, and the Press: Uncovering the Complexities of Media Coverage on Nigeria’s Social Investment Programmes, demonstrates rigorous comparative analysis of Nigerian and UK media, examining the influence of media narratives on public understanding of poverty and social policy. Completing his PhD with no corrections places him among the top 8% of UK doctoral candidates, reflecting exceptional scholarly rigour. His work bridges academic research with practical impact, evidenced by peer-reviewed publications with some published in Q2 journals, 262+ citations on Google Scholar, national news-media mentions in The Sun, Vanguard, and Premium Times, and policy-relevant insights.
In evaluating Dr. Arowolo's doctoral research, it is essential to highlight the robust methodology employed through its innovative comparative media analysis framework examining Nigerian and UK media coverage. The research demonstrates exceptional scholarly rigor through systematic comparative analysis that bridges quantitative content analysis with qualitative narrative examination. While the work shows significant strengths including measurable academic impact (262+ citations, top 8% PhD completion), it also acknowledges limitations such as geographic scope constraints and temporal snapshot considerations. Compared to existing literature, this research distinguishes itself through its innovative approach to bridging academic research with practical policy applications, providing unique cross-cultural insights that enhance understanding of how media narratives shape poverty policy discourse across different development contexts.
Beyond his doctoral research, Dr. Arowolo combines expertise in traditional and digital media production with digital innovation, including AI-driven content creation, immersive storytelling, and virtual production techniques. His technical proficiency spans advanced AI applications, cybersecurity and GDPR compliance, motion capture, and industry-standard software including Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Figma, and OBS. These capabilities position him to support the UK’s Creative Industries growth priorities, enhance regional digital skills, and develop next-generation creative talent.

In Medway, Dr. Arowolo is well-positioned to contribute directly to the University of Kent Docking Station and Digital Kent initiatives, providing training to over 500 participants, delivering cybersecurity consulting to more than 200 local businesses, and improving engagement outcomes by up to 76%. These contributions help address Medway’s 23% below-average digital skills rate, preparing communities for AI-driven and creative-tech roles and supporting regional economic growth.
Dr. Arowolo’s research, publications, and public engagement demonstrate measurable societal impact. Through strategic plans to partners with NGOs like Oxfam GB, NSPCC, and Plan International UK, given his background, he would be positioned to translate complex research into actionable frameworks that support UK Creative Industries and Professional and Business Services sectors. His initiatives foster scalable infrastructure for knowledge exchange and skills development while reinforcing the UK as a global hub for development communication research.
His teaching and mentorship record further strengthens his profile, spanning higher education, schools, and community training. He has delivered high-quality learning experiences across multiple campuses, improving student outcomes and equipping learners with the critical digital and creative skills required for the UK economy.
Dr. Arowolo’s scholarly contributions are complemented by a strategic vision for UK leadership in media and development research. His proposed establishment of the UK–Nigeria Media Research Consortium and the Global South Media Research Hub will generate high-impact scholarship, strengthen international collaborations, and support innovation adoption across the Creative Industries. His work is aligned with the 2025 UK Industrial Strategy objectives, including fostering investment, creating creative-tech employment, and reducing digital exclusion.
On the basis of his exceptional academic achievements, technical expertise, societal impact, and strategic positioning, I assess Dr. Arowolo as an outstanding candidate for the British Academy’s Exceptional Talent endorsement. I fully support his application and am confident that his contributions will deliver measurable benefits to UK research, policy, education, and the creative economy.
Yours sincerely,
Professor Winston Mano
