To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to offer my highest recommendation for Jeremie’s application for the Global Talent Visa. Jeremie has exceptional skills that have had a demonstrable impact on DG Digital’s growth. I believe his contribution to the UK technology sector will be outstanding. 

[Introduction to author & business]

My name is Esther Ojo. I am the Director of DG Digital, a Nigerian-based company specialising in full turnkey digital solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. We help create and maintain visually stunning and functional websites. We employ 200 people and have an annual turnover of £4.7 million, growing by 15% in 2024.

[Professional relationship]

I first met Jeremie at the Africa Tech Expo in 2019. He was speaking on Simplifying Your User Interface. The topic immediately captured our interest as it was central to what we wanted to achieve for our B2B clients moving forward. His knowledge blew us away. We spoke to him at the end of his speech, and our initial conversation prompted us to hire him 2 months later. 

He joined DG Digital as a senior software engineer. From the beginning, it was evident that Jeremie possessed a unique blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving abilities. Over the years, we have collaborated on numerous projects. I have seen firsthand how his contributions have enhanced our company’s offerings and success. He has consistently demonstrated exceptional talent and dedication to his work.

[Details of the applicant’s notable achievements]

Implementing Jeremie’s source coding has contributed to our impressive business growth. Since integrating his work, DG Digital has experienced a 15% year-on-year growth. Before Jeremie’s impact, we were growing at 6% year on year. This jump in growth rate indicates Jeremie’s contributions’ transformative impact. He was promoted to Senior Tech Manager and then CTO within 3 years. 

Jeremie’s impact on staff retention for our business has also been keenly felt. His exceptional management has kept the best talent in-house. Employment retention has gone up 33% since Jeremie was made CTO.

Jeremie’s contributions to DG Digital have not gone unnoticed within the industry, earning him industry-recognition including as the Digital Innovator of the Year award for two consecutive years (2022 and 2023). He contributed heavily to us winning the Best Web Development Company award at the Nigerian Tech Awards in 2023 for the first time in our history. 

[Why Jeremie is Exceptional?]

Jeremie’s innovative coding has enabled us to explore new business avenues. For instance, we have successfully signed multiple million-pound deals directly attributable to our website’s enhanced capabilities and reliability. One notable collaboration includes a £5 million contract with an international e-commerce platform. This was primarily facilitated by the advanced features and seamless integration of Jeremie and his team’s work.

Throughout his tenure at DG Digital, Jeremie has proven his abilities across several critical projects. Without the source coding managed and developed by Jeremie, our service would lag behind the competition. His contributions since then have been consistently exceptional. He has overhauled employee retention and new business. His business developments in artificial intelligence alone have saved over a million pounds across 3 years. 

[Achievements and Character]

Jeremie’s dedication to his work, attention to detail, and relentless pursuit of excellence set him apart. He is an exceptional coder and a team player who inspires and mentors his colleagues. His ability to remain calm under pressure and his willingness to take on challenging tasks are a testament to his outstanding work ethic and character.

[Prospects in the UK and Potential Contribution to the Digital Economy]

Jeremie’s technical expertise, innovative mindset, and proven track record of driving business success make him an exemplary candidate for the Global Talent Visa.

I firmly believe that Jeremie will significantly contribute to the UK digital economy. His exceptional talent, dedication, and innovative approach make him a key asset to any organisation. The UK’s digital sector benefits greatly from his skills, particularly in driving technological advancements and fostering growth in small and medium-sized enterprises.

[Conclusion]

I wholeheartedly support Jeremie’s application and believe he will continue to make outstanding contributions to the field. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.

Sincerely,

Esther Ojo

CEO, DG Digital
