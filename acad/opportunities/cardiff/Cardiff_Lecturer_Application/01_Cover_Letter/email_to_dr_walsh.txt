Subject: Inquiry regarding Lecturer (Teaching and Research) position - 20354BR

Dear Dr. Walsh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Lecturer (Teaching and Research) position (20354BR) at Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, and would greatly value your insights as I prepare my application.

Given Cardiff's exceptional REF 2021 ranking as 2nd in the UK for journalism, media and communications research, I'm particularly interested in understanding how the school is currently integrating emerging research areas like AI and data studies into both the curriculum and research agenda. Could you share insights on how this three-year lecturership might contribute to advancing these specific research priorities while maintaining the school's internationally recognized teaching standards?

My background aligns closely with the position's focus areas, particularly in digital research methods and AI/internet studies, and I am eager to understand how I could best contribute to the school's continued excellence in these domains.

I understand the deadline is rapidly approaching (August 6th), and I would be grateful for any guidance you could provide on the application process or key aspects the selection committee will be prioritizing.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
