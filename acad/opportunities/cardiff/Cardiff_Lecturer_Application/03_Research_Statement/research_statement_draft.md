# Research Statement

## Lecturer (Teaching and Research) Position

### Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies

## Research Vision and Alignment

My research sits at the intersection of **media sociology, digital journalism, and democratic engagement**, with a particular focus on how media systems shape public understanding of social inequality and policy interventions. My doctoral work at the University of Kent examined the complex relationship between media coverage and Nigeria's social investment programmes, employing mixed-methods approaches that combined content analysis, in-depth interviews, and social media discourse analysis. This research directly aligns with Cardiff's emphasis on **digital research methods** and **AI, Internet and Data Studies**, as I increasingly incorporate computational approaches to understand contemporary media ecosystems.

## Current Research Portfolio

My research program operates across interconnected streams that collectively examine how media systems shape democratic participation, public understanding, and social transformation in the digital age. These projects leverage both established and emerging research methodologies to address pressing questions at the intersection of media, technology, and society.

### Primary Research Streams

**1. Digital Journalism and Democratic Participation**
My foundational research investigates how digital technologies reshape journalistic practice and democratic engagement, particularly in contexts of social inequality. This stream includes my forthcoming book chapter on East African journalists' perspectives on AI in news production (co-authored with University of Missouri, BBC World Service, and Syracuse University colleagues), representing my commitment to **international collaborative research** on technology's role in journalism.

**2. Media Representation and Social Policy**
Building on my doctoral research examining media coverage of Nigeria's social investment programmes, I develop comparative research examining how UK and African media systems represent poverty and social policy interventions. This work employs **digital media methods** including computational text analysis and social media network analysis to understand policy narrative circulation across platforms.

**3. Independent Journalism Ecosystems**
My ongoing comparative study of independent journalism funding models in the UK and Nigeria directly addresses Cardiff's **creative industries policy** priorities, examining how technological disruption and changing funding models affect journalistic independence and democratic accountability.

**4. Contemporary Nigerian Newsroom Mapping (Active Data Collection)**
Currently leading "Mapping the Contemporary Nigerian Newsroom," a nationwide survey examining **professional identity in contemporary Nigerian journalism**. This project addresses critical questions about professional qualification standards as individuals from diverse academic backgrounds increasingly assume key media roles.

**Project Status**: Data collection phase (June 10 - August 30, 2025) via Qualtrics online survey targeting 500-1,000 participants across Nigeria. This represents the first comprehensive mapping of Nigeria's contemporary newsroom demographics.

**5. Science Communication and Public Engagement (Pilot Study Completed)**
"Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Research and Public Engagement in Nigeria: Rethinking Media Practices in the Digital Age" examines how media mediates public access to scientific research outputs. This mixed-methods study (content analysis and in-depth interviews with journalists, researchers, and science communicators) addresses challenges including limited editorial capacity, politicized media ownership, and digital misinformation ecosystems.

**Project Status**: Pilot study completed; findings to be presented at the International Conference on Science Communication, African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, October 2025. This research directly contributes to **Public Communication of Science and Technology (PCST)** initiatives and aligns with Cardiff's emphasis on **digital research methods** and **public engagement**.

## Research Methods and Innovation

My methodological expertise spans **qualitative and digital research approaches**:

- **Advanced qualitative methods**: In-depth interviews, focus groups, thematic analysis using NVivo
- **Computational approaches**: Content analysis using SPSS, social media data analysis
- **Mixed-methods design**: Integration of traditional qualitative methods with digital data collection and analysis
- **Systematic literature reviews**: Comprehensive evidence synthesis approaches

This methodological versatility positions me to contribute to Cardiff's **Digital Research Methods** research area while mentoring students in contemporary research approaches.
