Subject: Request for Approval – Listing Your Name in My CV for Academic Applications

Dear Professor Scott,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to respectfully request your approval to list your name in my CV under the “References” section for my upcoming academic applications.

As my external examiner for my PhD viva held on 31 July 2025, your role was instrumental in validating my research and academic standards. Your affiliation as Professor of Media & Development at the University of East Anglia adds significant weight to my profile, and I would be honoured to include your name as a referee.

Details of Listing:
- Name: Professor Martin Scott  
- Title/Position: Professor of Media & Development, University of East Anglia  
- Relationship: External PhD Examiner  
- Contact: Martin.Scott@uea.ac.uk (shared only upon request from hiring committees)

I will ensure your contact details are not publicly disclosed and will only be shared if a hiring committee explicitly requests references. If you prefer any adjustments to how your name or affiliation is presented, I am happy to accommodate.

Please let me know if you are comfortable with this, or if you would like to discuss further. I completely understand if you prefer otherwise and will respect your decision.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
