I am Dr. Olasunkanmi Arowolo, a distinguished media scholar with a rare PhD distinction and 262+ citations. My UK-Nigeria comparative research on media and poverty directly addresses development challenges. My Research Africa platform bridges global scholarship gaps. I offer evidence-based strategies for development organizations, transforming media from observer to catalyst for change. My Global Talent Visa application formalizes the inevitable partnership with UK development organizations.
