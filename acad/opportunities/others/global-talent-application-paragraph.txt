Strategic Partnerships for UK Industrial Strategy Leadership in Development Communication Research

My exceptional positioning for partnerships with leading development and human rights organisations directly advances the UK's Industrial Strategy objectives across the Creative Industries and Professional Business Services sectors. With a rare PhD distinction (zero corrections, top 8% nationally) and 262+ citations, I offer Oxfam GB, NSPCC, Plan International UK, and similar organisations a pioneering UK-Nigeria comparative framework that transforms how media narratives shape poverty alleviation and child rights advocacy—directly contributing to the UK's £31 billion creative industries investment target by 2035.

My Research Africa platform demonstrates innovation in bridging global scholarship gaps, positioning the UK as the international hub for development communication research while supporting the Creative Content Exchange and Creative Industries R&D investment (£100M clusters + £25M Creative Futures). My proven ability to translate complex research into actionable communication strategies—with measurable 76% engagement improvements—positions me to deliver immediate, quantifiable impact that aligns with the Industrial Strategy's focus on driving innovation adoption and building resilient creative supply chains.

These partnerships will establish the UK as the global centre for innovative development communication research, directly supporting my Global Talent Visa application through sustained contributions to UK business investment growth (£65 billion professional services target by 2035) and international collaboration. This work bridges academic research excellence with practical implementation across the Creative Industries and Professional Business Services sectors, creating scalable frameworks that attract international investment while developing next-generation creative talent through knowledge transfer and industry training programmes.
