Subject: Clarification on Section Editor Role at the Journal of Cogent Psychology

Dear Ms. MacKenzie,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently reviewed the details provided for the Section Editor position at the *Journal of Cogent Psychology* and am very interested in applying. However, I would appreciate some clarification to ensure my application aligns with the journal's expectations.

I also wanted to mention that I received a sponsored LinkedIn email from Ben Hudson regarding this opportunity, which further piqued my interest in the role.

Could you kindly provide more information on:

- The specific responsibilities and time commitment expected of a Section Editor.
- The key qualifications or experiences you are prioritizing in candidates.
- Whether my background in academic publishing, peer review, and leadership roles in research aligns with the journal's vision for this role.

I hold a PhD in Journalism (awarded without corrections) and have extensive experience in academic publishing, including serving as a blind peer reviewer for Q2 journals and leading academic platforms. I am eager to understand how my skills and experiences might contribute to the journal's mission.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and would be happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Best regards,
