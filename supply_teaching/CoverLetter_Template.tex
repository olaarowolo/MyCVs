\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager / Head Teacher,}

\textbf{Re: Application for Cover Teacher / Cover Supervisor Position}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Cover Teacher/Cover Supervisor position at [School Name]. With over eight years of international teaching experience and extensive cover teaching experience across Kent schools, I am confident in my ability to provide a safe, engaging, and productive learning environment for your pupils in the absence of their regular teachers.

\textbf{Relevant Experience and Skills:}

My recent experience as a Cover Teacher and Cover Supervisor through Kent Teaching Solution Agency and Teacher Active has equipped me with the specific skills required for effective supply teaching. I have successfully covered lessons across diverse subjects including Media, English, Arts, History, Science, Business, Computing, and Health \& Social Care at schools including The Victory Academy, Walderslade Girls' School, Brompton Academy, and Chatham Grammar School, among others.

Key strengths I bring to this role include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Immediate Impact:} Proven ability to quickly adapt to different school environments, policies, and procedures while maintaining high standards of classroom management
\item \textbf{Subject Versatility:} Demonstrated competence in delivering pre-planned lessons across multiple subject areas with minimal preparation time
\item \textbf{Behavior Management:} Strong classroom management skills with experience working with diverse age groups and pupils with varying abilities, including those with SEND
\item \textbf{Professional Communication:} Excellent interpersonal skills for effective liaison with pupils, staff, and parents, ensuring seamless continuity in the absence of regular teachers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Educational Background and Professional Development:}

I hold a PhD in Journalism from the University of Kent (2025) and have recently completed a lecturing contract at East Kent College, where I taught Health and Social Care to 76 students. My academic background, combined with practical teaching experience, enables me to bring both theoretical knowledge and real-world application to the classroom.

My commitment to professional development is evidenced by my recent completion of courses in creative thinking, design processes, and digital marketing, which enhance my ability to engage pupils through innovative teaching approaches.

\textbf{Reliability and Commitment:}

I understand the critical importance of reliability in supply teaching. Throughout my cover teaching assignments, I have maintained an excellent attendance record and have consistently received positive feedback from schools regarding my professionalism, punctuality, and ability to maintain classroom standards.

I am available for both short-term and long-term assignments and can accommodate last-minute bookings when needed. My local knowledge of Kent schools and familiarity with various educational systems positions me well to provide immediate, effective coverage.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to maintaining the high educational standards at [School Name]. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can provide references from previous supply teaching assignments upon request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
